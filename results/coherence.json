She lived in the United States illegally for years, receiving public assistance in Boston.Aunt Zeituni, as she has come to be known, first surfaced in the public light in 2008, in the final days of the Presidential election. Then-candidate Obama said that he was not against the possible deportation of his aunt. \"If she has violated laws, then those laws have to be obeyed,\" he told CBS's Katie Couric. \"We are a nation of laws.\"Onyango had violated the law, and she knew it.\"I knew I had overstayed\" she told WBZ-TV's Jonathan Elias when the two sat down one-on-one.Zeituni Onyango said she came to the United States in 2000 and had every intention of leaving. Then, however, she says she got deathly ill and was hospitalized. When she recovered, she said she was broke and couldn't afford to leave.For two years Onyango said she lived in a homeless shelter, before she was assigned public housing despite thousands of legal residents also awaiting assistance. \"I didn't take any advantage of the system. The system took advantage of me.\"\"I didn't ask for it; they gave it to me. Ask your system. I didn't create it or vote for it. Go and ask your system,\" she said unapologetically.And she's right. The system provided her assistance despite her status as an illegal immigrant.In 2004 a judge ordered Zeituni Onyango out of the country, but she never left. She stayed, hiding in plain sight. In 2005 she attended her nephew's swearing in as the junior Senator of Illinois. In 2008 she was invited to, and traveled to D.C. for President Obama's inauguration.However her nephew, she says, never pulled any strings for her.\"Listen. Obama did not know my whereabouts.\"Onyango hired a top immigration lawyer from Cleveland to help fight her case. We asked how she afforded that lawyer, when she claimed poverty.\"When you believe in Jesus Christ and almighty God, my help comes from heaven,\" she responded.When asked about cutting in line ahead of those who have paid into the system she answered plainly, \"I don't mind. You can take that house. I will be on the street with the homeless.\"\"To me America's dream became America's worst nightmare,\" she said adamantly. \"I have been treated like public enemy number one.\"She is still living in South Boston public housing, unemployed, and collecting about $700 a month in disability, she says. And now, Zeituni Onlyango is in this country legally.In May 2010, Onyango's case went back before the same judge who ordered her out of the country in 2004. This time she was granted asylum in the United States. The ruling said a return to Kenya might put Onyango in danger.Did her nephew, the President of the United States influence that immigration judge? \"No influence at all, from nobody, from nowhere,\" Onyango said. \n \n (\u00a9 MMX, CBS Broadcasting Inc.

Not his father; not his mother; not his wife or brother - he'll fight with him. But Auntie is a much honored person in African culture.\" \n \n This may be the case in Africa, but in the United States the President's Aunt Zeituni Onyango hasn't been revered, but reviled by many. \n \n For years she lived illegally in Boston public housing. She's unemployed, receiving nearly $700 a month in disability, and for nearly ten years was in this country illegally. \n \n CARRYING HER OWN CROSS? \n \n Onyango sat down recently with WBZ-TV's Jonathan Elias, to set her side of the record straight. \n \n \"I'm not the President's obligation. I carry my own cross.\" \n \n That's the problem; she hasn't been carrying her own cross. The taxpayers have, and many are angry that she has been able to live on public assistance for so long, while others who paid into the system are denied those same benefits. \n \n \"It's a great country,\" she said. \"It's nice to live here. You can do whatever you want when you live here.\" \n \n Despite what's she's been given, Zeituni Onyango said flatly that she owes this country nothing in return. \"But, it's given you so much?\" Elias asked. \"So? It's a free country under God,\" was her terse response. \n \n ILLEGAL TO LEGAL \n \n The President's aunt arrived in Boston in 2000. When her visa expired she said she was too sick to leave. She stayed in a homeless shelter for two years, and was then assigned public housing, all along, violating the law. \n \n \"I knew I had overstayed,\" she admitted. \n \n In 2004, Zeituni Onyango was ordered out of the country, but never left. After her nephew became President, the same judge that once ordered her deported changed his mind. In May 2010 she was granted asylum. \n \n One of the reasons the judge cited for the change is Onyango's relationship to Obama. He ruled that connection would make her a target in Kenya, writing, \"she faces at least a 10 percent chance of future persecution in Kenya.\" \n \n TAXPAYERS' BURDEN \n \n When asked why the taxpayers should be burdened with her needs, the feisty Zeituni said, \"This country is owned by almighty God. You people who preach Jesus Christ almighty God and the rest of it, you are here to help people, help the poor, help other countries and help women. That's what the United States is supposed to do? And you have to give me my right light, every person's right.\" \n \n \"Do you want to become an American citizen?\" Elias asked. \n \n \"If I didn't why the hell would I have been here all this time?\" she responded. \n \n RELATIONSHIP WITH OBAMA \n \n Onyango said her relationship with her nephew is close, but that she has not been invited to D.C. \n \n \"I don't have any business in Washington D.C., in White House. Jesus, don't I have other things to do?\" \n \n She said President Obama has not helped in her fight to gain asylum, nor has he helped financially, to get her off public assistance. \n \n The fact is, Zeituni Onyango now has the legal right to stay and she continues living in Boston public housing, and getting her monthly disability checks. \n \n 'GOD'S MIRACLES' \n \n Many in Boston have expressed anger that the President's aunt has been living off a system that she never paid for, and was never entitled to. To this day, she does not understand that anger, nor does she think anything she has received is unfair. \n \n \"That's God's miracles,\" she said. \"Don't you believe in miracles?\" \n \n (\u00a9 MMX, CBS Broadcasting Inc.

        "Summary": "Zeituni Onyango, the aunt of President Barack Obama, lived in the United States illegally for years and received public assistance in Boston. Despite being ordered deported in 2004, she stayed in the country and was granted asylum in 2010 due to potential danger in Kenya. Onyango claims the system took advantage of her and asserts that Obama did not assist her in her legal battles. She currently lives in Boston public housing and receives $700 a month in disability. Onyango believes the country is owned by God and owes nothing in return for the assistance she received.",

(He adopted the first and middle names Sherwin Bernard when he went to kindergarten.) His childhood was spent in a tiny South Bronx apartment with his parents, his older brother, his maternal grandmother and a maiden aunt, in an atmosphere permeated with sickness and death. \n \n A brother died before Dr. Nuland was born, and at age 3 he was hospitalized for diphtheria. His mother, the emotional center of his family, died of colon cancer when he was 11. In his memoir, \u201cLost in America\u201d (2003), he recalled with striking vividness the bad smells and bloody pads that came from his mother\u2019s room. \n \n Dr. Nuland\u2019s adolescent years were dominated by his father, Meyer Nudelman, a garment worker who was incapacitated by chronic illness and physical infirmities; he could not walk more than a short distance without his son\u2019s help. Resisting a new way of life, the father never learned to read or write English \u2014 Yiddish was the predominant language at home \u2014 and he terrified his family with explosive rages. \n \n Dr. Nuland regarded him with fear and shame, emotions that would take a deep psychological toll. \n \n While still in high school, Dr. Nuland and his older brother changed their names from Nudelman, separating themselves from a weak, angry man who, Dr. Nuland wrote, represented \u201ceverything I so desperately wanted to be rid of.\u201d They chose a name first adopted by a cousin, Willie Nuland, a physician who looked after the boys\u2019 parents when they were ill, and whose compassion and competence pointed Dr. Nuland toward his career. \n \n Dr. Nuland received his bachelor\u2019s degree from New York University in 1951 and went on to study medicine at Yale, attracted by its distance \u2014 geographically and culturally \u2014 from the old-world Jewishness in which he grew up. Reading about spinal cord diseases as a medical student, Dr. Nuland discovered that his father\u2019s crippling illness was tertiary, or chronic, syphilis. Dr. Nuland felt anger, and then pity. \u201cI now had some perception of the tragedy of his life,\u201d he wrote in his memoir. \n \n Dr. Nuland received his medical degree from Yale in 1955. Electing to specialize in surgery, he set his sights on becoming chief surgical resident at Yale-New Haven Hospital, entering a Darwinian competition for a position seldom occupied by Jews. In 1958, Dr. Nuland won the coveted appointment. Four days later, his father died of complications of syphilis, a condition Mr. Nudelman did not know he had. \n \n \u201cI think that one time, before he was married, Meyer Nudelman was very unlucky,\u201d Dr. Nuland said in a 2003 interview with The New York Times. ||||| HAMDEN, Conn.

Nuland, center, and James Tate greet each other after the awards ceremony in... (Associated Press) \n \n FILE - In this May 28, 1996, file photo, Dr. Sherwin Nuland sits on the desk in his home study in Hamden, Conn. Nuland, the author of 1994 National Book Award winner \"How We Die,\" has died at age 83.... (Associated Press) \n \n He died of prostate cancer on Monday at his home in Hamden, said his daughter Amelia Nuland, who recalled how he told her he wasn't ready for death because he loved life. \n \n \"He told me, 'I'm not scared of dying, but I've built such a beautiful life, and I'm not ready to leave it,'\" she said Tuesday. \n \n Sherwin Nuland was born in New York and taught medical ethics at Yale University in New Haven. He was critical of the medical profession's obsession with prolonging life when common sense would dictate further treatment is futile. He wrote nature \"will always win in the end, as it must if our species is to survive.\" \n \n \"The necessity of nature's final victory was accepted in generations before our own,\" he wrote. \"Doctors were far more willing to recognize the signs of defeat and far less arrogant about denying them.\" \n \n \"How We Die: Reflections on Life's Final Chapter\" was published in 1994 and won a National Book Award for nonfiction, beating out a book about Supreme Court Justice Clarence Thomas and three other finalists. In it Nuland describes how life is lost to diseases and old age. It helped foster national debate over doctor-assisted suicide and end-of-life decisions. \n \n Nuland, a surgeon, said in a 1996 interview he hoped that when his time came he would go gently \"without suffering and surrounded by loved ones.\" He said then, when he was 65, that if his death certificate were to read, \"Died of Old Age,\" he thought that \"would be very nice.\" \n \n His daughter said he and his family had talked all the time about his illness and his impending death. She said there were times when he was \"very much at peace\" and occasional times toward the end when he seemed scared and sad. \n \n \"He wasn't scared of death itself, but he loved everything about his world and the people in his world and life and life,\" she said. \"And he didn't want to leave.\"",
        "Summary": "Sherwin Nuland, born Shepsel Ber Nudelman on Dec. 8, 1930, in the Bronx to Orthodox Jewish parents from Russia, changed his name to Sherwin Bernard in kindergarten. He grew up in a small South Bronx apartment with his family, experiencing significant illness and death, including his mother's death from colon cancer when he was 11. His father, Meyer Nudelman, a garment worker, suffered from chronic syphilis and had a difficult relationship with his family. Sherwin and his brother changed their surname to Nuland in high school. Sherwin graduated from New York University in 1951 and studied medicine at Yale, where he specialized in surgery and became chief surgical resident at Yale-New Haven Hospital. He discovered his father's illness was syphilis during his medical studies. Sherwin Nuland wrote the award-winning book 'How We Die,' which won a National Book Award in 1994. He died of prostate cancer at age 83 in Hamden, Connecticut, and was survived by his daughter, Amelia Nuland. He taught medical ethics at Yale University and was critical of the medical profession's focus on prolonging life unnecessarily.",

        "Document": "I. The operation of the HYSY 981 drilling rig \n \n On 2 May 2014, a Chinese company's HYSY 981 drilling rig started its drilling operation inside the contiguous zone of China's Xisha Islands (see Annex 1/5 for the locations of operation) for the purpose of oil and gas exploration. With the first phase of the operation completed, the second phase began on 27 May. The two locations of operation are 17 nautical miles from both the Zhongjian Island of China's Xisha Islands and the baseline of the territorial waters of Xisha Islands, yet approximately 133 to 156 nautical miles away from the coast of the Vietnamese mainland. \n \n The Chinese company has been conducting explorations in the related waters for the past 10 years, including seismic operations and well site surveys. The drilling operation carried out by HYSY 981 this time is a continuation of the routine process of explorations, and falls well within China's sovereignty and jurisdiction. \n \n II. Vietnam's provocation \n \n Shortly after the Chinese operation started, Vietnam sent a large number of vessels, including armed vessels, to the site, illegally and forcefully disrupting the Chinese operation and ramming the Chinese government vessels on escort and security missions there. In the meantime, Vietnam also sent frogmen and other underwater agents to the area, and dropped large numbers of obstacles, including fishing nets and floating objects, in the waters. As of 5 pm on 7 June, there were as many as 63 Vietnamese vessels in the area at the peak, attempting to break through China's cordon and ramming the Chinese government ships for a total of 1,416 times. \n \n The above-mentioned actions of the Vietnamese side were serious infringements upon China's sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction, grave threats to the safety of Chinese personnel and the HYSY 981 drilling rig, and gross violations of the relevant international laws, including the Charter of the United Nations, the 1982 UN Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) and 1988 Convention for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Maritime Navigation and the Protocol for the Suppression of Unlawful Acts against the Safety of Fixed Platforms Located on the Continental Shelf. Such actions also undermined the freedom and safety of navigation in these waters, and damaged peace and stability in the region. \n \n While illegally and forcefully disrupting the normal operation of the Chinese company on the sea, Vietnam also condoned anti-China demonstrations at home. In mid-May, thousands of lawless elements in Vietnam conducted beating, smashing, looting and arson against companies of China and several other countries. They brutally killed four Chinese nationals and injured over 300 others, and caused heavy property losses. \n \n III. China's response \n \n The waters between China's Xisha Islands and the coast of the Vietnamese mainland are yet to be delimited. The two sides have not yet conducted delimitation of the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) and continental shelf in these waters. Both sides are entitled to claim EEZ and continental shelf in accordance with the UNCLOS. However, these waters will never become Vietnam's EEZ and continental shelf no matter which principle is applied in the delimitation. \n \n In the face of Vietnam's provocative actions on the sea, China exercised great restraint and took necessary preventive measures. Chinese government ships were dispatched to the site for the purpose of ensuring the safety of the operation, which effectively safeguarded the order of production and operation on the sea and the safety of navigation. In the meantime, since 2 May, China has conducted over 30 communications with Vietnam at various levels, requesting the Vietnamese side to stop its illegal disruption. Regrettably, however, the illegal disruption of the Vietnamese side is still continuing. \n \n IV. Xisha Islands are part of the Chinese territory \n \n 1. Xisha Islands are an inherent part of China's territory, over which there is no dispute. \n \n China was the first to discover, develop, exploit and exercise jurisdiction over the Xisha Islands. During the Northern Song Dynasty (960-1126 AD), the Chinese government already established jurisdiction over the Xisha Islands and sent naval forces to patrol the waters there. In 1909, Commander Li Zhun of the Guangdong naval force of the Qing Dynasty led a military inspection mission to the Xisha Islands and reasserted China's sovereignty by hoisting the flag and firing a salvo on the Yongxing Island. In 1911, the government of the Republic of China announced its decision to put the Xisha Islands and their adjacent waters under the jurisdiction of Ya County of Hainan Island. \n \n Japan invaded and occupied the Xisha Islands during the Second World War. After Japan's surrender in 1945, in accordance with a series of international documents, the Chinese government sent senior officials boarding military vessels to the Xisha Islands in November 1946 to hold the ceremony for receiving the islands, and a stone tablet was erected to commemorate the handover and troops were stationed there afterwards. The Xisha Islands, which had once been illegally occupied by a foreign country, were thus returned to the jurisdiction of the Chinese government. \n \n In 1959, the Chinese government established the Administration Office for the Xisha, Zhongsha and Nansha Islands. In January 1974, the Chinese military and people drove the invading army of the Saigon authority of South Vietnam from the Shanhu Island and Ganquan Island of the Xisha Islands and defended China's territory and sovereignty. The Chinese government enacted the Law of the People's Republic of China on the Territorial Sea and the Contiguous Zone in 1992 and published the base points and baselines of the territorial waters of the Xisha Islands in 1996, both of which reaffirm China's sovereignty over the Xisha Islands and the extent of territorial waters of the islands. In 2012, the Chinese government established the various departments of Sansha city on the Yongxing Island of Xisha Islands. \n \n 2. Prior to 1974, none of the successive Vietnamese governments had ever challenged China's sovereignty over the Xisha Islands. Vietnam had officially recognized the Xisha Islands as part of China's territory since ancient times. This position was reflected in its government statements and notes as well as its newspapers, maps and textbooks. \n \n During a meeting with charg\u00e9 d'affaires ad interim Li Zhimin of the Chinese Embassy in Vietnam on 15 June 1956, Vice Foreign Minister of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam Ung Van Khiem solemnly stated that, \"according to Vietnamese data, the Xisha Islands and Nansha Islands are historically part of Chinese territory.\" Le Loc, Acting Director of the Asian Department of the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry, who was present, specifically cited Vietnamese data and pointed out that, \"judging from history, these islands were already part of China at the time of the Song Dynasty.\" \n \n On 4 September 1958, the Chinese government issued a declaration (see Annex 2/5), stating that the breadth of the territorial waters of the People's Republic of China shall be 12 nautical miles and making it clear that \"this provision applies to all the territories of the People's Republic of China, including ... the Xisha Islands\". On 6 September, NHAN DAN, the official newspaper of the Central Committee of Vietnamese Workers' Party, published on its front page the full text of the Chinese government's declaration regarding China's territorial sea. On 14 September, Premier Pham Van Dong of the government of Vietnam sent a diplomatic note (see Annex 3/5) to Premier Zhou Enlai of the State Council of China, solemnly stating that \"the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam recognizes and supports the declaration of the government of the People's Republic of China on its decision concerning China's territorial sea made on September 4, 1958\" and \"the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam respects this decision\". \n \n On 9 May 1965, the government of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam issued a statement with reference to the designation by the US government of the \"combat zone\" of the US armed forces in Vietnam. It says, \"US President Lyndon Johnson designated the whole of Vietnam, and the adjacent waters which extend roughly 100 miles from the coast of Vietnam and part of the territorial waters of the People's Republic of China in its Xisha Islands as 'combat zone' of the United States armed forces ... in direct threat to the security of the Democratic Republic of Vietnam and its neighbors ...\" \n \n The World Atlas printed in May 1972 by the Bureau of Survey and Cartography under the Office of the Premier of Vietnam designated the Xisha Islands by their Chinese names (see Annex 4/5). The geography textbook for ninth graders published by Vietnam's Educational Press in 1974 carried in it a lesson entitled \"The People's Republic of China\" (see Annex 5/5). It reads, \"The chain of islands from the Nansha and Xisha Islands to Hainan Island, Taiwan Island, the Penghu Islands and the Zhoushan Islands ... are shaped like a bow and constitute a Great Wall defending the China mainland.\" \n \n But now the Vietnamese government goes back on its word by making territorial claims over China's Xisha Islands. That is a gross violation of the principles of international law, including the principle of estoppel, and the basic norms governing international relations. \n \n V. Properly addressing the situation \n \n China is a staunch force for maintaining peace and stability in the South China Sea and promoting cooperation between and development of countries in the region. China firmly upholds the purpose and principles of the Charter of the United Nations, the basic norms of international relations and fundamental principles of international law. The least China wants is any turbulence in its neighborhood. \n \n China wants good relations with Vietnam, but there are principles that China cannot abandon. The channel of communication between China and Vietnam is open. China urges Vietnam to bear in mind the overall interests of the bilateral relations and peace and stability in the South China Sea, respect China's sovereignty, sovereign rights and jurisdiction, immediately stop all forms of disruptions of the Chinese operation and withdraw all vessels and personnel from the site, so as to ease the tension and restore tranquility at sea as early as possible. China will continue its effort to communicate with Vietnam with a view to properly addressing the current situation. \n \n VI.

        "Document": "WTF, TO? \n \n Not only am I a bit unclear on why Rob Ford still has the keys to the Mayor's office; I also have no idea why he's not in jail. For you or I, smoking crack would at least warrant a trip downtown. In Ford's case, it only caused Toronto to collectively exclaim, \"That explains a lot!\" \n \n Following the Rob Ford crack scandal (and we're not even talking about the alleged prostitute scandal... yet), Ford's handlers had one job. That job was to keep Ford out of the public eye, so Toronto's city government could let its black eye heal. \n \n (Boing Boing's Cory Doctorow has a particular nickname for Rob Ford, one for which I can find no counterargument.) \n \n What his staff should have done is insist Ford go only from home to work, chauffeured to and fro with a canvas sack over his head like Tom Cruise in the first \"Mission: Impossible\" film. Make sure he cannot screw things up more than he already has. \n \n Yet here we are. \n \n Rob Ford proves\u2013\u2013 again\u2013\u2013 that if you're rich and white and connected, you can do whatever the hell you want. \n \n That extends to making a horse's ass of yourself at a restaurant, putting on a Jamaican accent as your cohorts pretend not to know you. \n \n Google's autocomplete shows that many of you have been asking... \n \n The answer is because Ontario's provincial government would basically have to pass a special law to kick Ford to the curb, and Premier Kathleen Wynne lacks the political clout to make that happen. While Ford been stripped of some of his responsibilities, he still has a job, and it'll stay that way unless he gets charged with a crime and subsequently convicted. \n \n Until that happens, expect more of the same, because rewarded behaviour is repeated. At least now we know why Rob Ford hasn't been impeached; if it were too easy to get rid of a Mayor, they'd be getting turfed out every few months. \n \n Meanwhile, we're learning that racist, homophobic, drunken crackheads don't go to jail simply for being racist, homophobic, drunken crackheads, at least not in Toronto. However, do not try this at home. \n \n In the meantime, let us all join hands and pray that the next headline we read is not \"Rob Ford sex tape revealed\". \n \n Oh, and I don't care how authentic Ford's Jamaican accent is. ||||| Several prisoners shattered the teeth and broke the leg of Rob Ford's estranged brother-in-law in a jailhouse beating that was intended to keep him quiet about the Toronto mayor's abuse of alcohol and illegal drugs, it has been alleged in a lawsuit. \n \n The 2012 jailhouse assault of Scott MacIntyre was orchestrated by Aedan Petros, Mr. MacIntyre has alleged in a statement of claim. Mr. Petros is a 300-pound, violent criminal who played defensive tackle for Mr. Ford when he was the coach of the football team at Don Bosco Catholic Secondary School. \n \n When Mr. MacIntyre was attacked in the shower on March 22, 2012, at the Toronto West Detention Centre, it came after several weeks of threats from inmates who urged the 46-year-old repeat offender to \"do the right thing,\" Mr. MacIntyre said separately in an hour-long interview with The Globe and Mail. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n \"They wanted to know if I was going to do the right thing \u2013\u2013 was I going to keep my mouth shut,\" Mr. MacIntyre told The Globe. The inmates and Mr. Petros \u2013 a 22-year-old who was jailed in connection with an armed robbery and home invasion and has since been sentenced to five years in a federal penitentiary \u2013 repeatedly approached Mr. MacIntyre with warnings, such as \"there is no use in bringing Rob into this; what's done behind closed doors stays behind closed doors. \u2026 Stuff of that nature,\" Mr. MacIntyre said. The statement of claim, filed in Toronto on Wednesday, makes similar allegations about the threats. \n \n An official with the Ministry of Correctional Services, who spoke on condition of anonymity, confirmed to The Globe that Mr. Petros was housed in the same unit of the jail, known as 1B, as Mr. MacIntyre at the time of the assault. \n \n Brent Ross, a ministry spokesman, said an investigation into the beating had been launched, but he declined to release its findings, citing concerns about jail security. Mayor Ford did not respond to a list of questions that was sent to him by e-mail and in a letter. He did, however, speak about The Globe's inquiries with the Toronto Sun, telling the newspaper that any suggestion that he played a role in the beating is \"far fetched\" and \"way out there.\" Mr. Ford's lawyer and close adviser, Dennis Morris, said the notion that the mayor had advance knowledge of the attack on Mr. MacIntyre was \"insanity.\" \n \n Mr. Morris said the allegations in the lawsuit are \"without fact or foundation.\" Mr. Ford has retained Gavin Tighe, a Bay Street litigator, to represent him in the civil suit. Mr. MacIntyre is being represented by Sean Dewart and Tim Gleason, who declined comment. \n \n None of the claims in Mr. MacIntyre's lawsuit, which lists Mr. Ford, Mr. Petros, another former football coach named Payman Aboodowleh, as well as the Minister of Correctional Services as defendants, have been proven in court. \n \n The lawsuit touches on one of the more enduring mysteries of the scandal that has engulfed Mayor Ford since he became the focus of a sweeping police investigation and admitted to smoking crack cocaine: what was an Ontario provincial court judge referring to in 2012 when he said he inferred that Mr. MacIntyre was beaten in jail because he was \"a bother to Mr. Ford?\" \n \n Mr. MacIntyre wound up in jail in January, 2012, after police were called to Mayor Ford's house because of a confrontation between the mayor and Mr. MacIntyre, which culminated with Mr. MacIntyre threatening to kill Mr. Ford. (In his statement of claim, Mr. MacIntyre alleges that the argument stemmed from a debt that was owed to him by his then common-law spouse, Kathy Ford, the mayor's older sister.) Mr. MacIntyre eventually pleaded guilty to threatening the mayor with death, as well as possession of cocaine and heroin. But when he was sentenced in June, 2012 \u2013 several months after the jailhouse attack \u2013 the judge presiding over the case, Mr. Justice Paul French, called the attack a case of \"so-called jailhouse justice.\" \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n \"I infer that it was visited upon Mr. MacIntyre because of his being a bother to Mr. Ford,\" Judge French said. \n \n Judge French's comments were widely reported in the media, though he never elaborated on what led him to this conclusion. \n \n Mr. MacIntyre's lawsuit and his interview with The Globe are his first public description of the beating that his statement of claim says left him with a severely fractured tibia and fibula, and at least four teeth that were \"sheared at the gum line.\" \n \n Mr. MacIntyre is familiar with the confines of the Toronto West Detention Centre. He is a convicted drug trafficker who has served prison stints in both Canada and the United Kingdom. He has suffered from a drug addiction that he says he has kicked over the past two years. \n \n So, when he was jailed again in January, 2012, he says he repeatedly asked to be placed in a range of the jail, unit 3A, that typically houses older and calmer inmates. But his requests were denied, his statement of claim alleges, and he continued to be kept in the general population. \n \n \"I have been incarcerated many times and I could feel the tension,\" Mr. MacIntyre said in the interview. \"Plus [the story of the arrest] was all over the news and everybody from the Rexdale area and I was getting bombarded with questions. I just had a bad feeling,\" he said. \n \n Story continues below advertisement \n \n About two weeks after he was admitted to jail, on Jan. 27, Mr. MacIntyre sent a letter to Kathy Ford, which the court later called a violation of his no-contact order with the mayor. He threatened to cause \"a shitstorm.\" \n \n \"You and your family have one chance to leave me the fuck alone and stop this shit!,\" he wrote in the letter. \"You and your family think I should play nice! Fuck you.\" \n \n But the letter was intercepted by jail officials. As punishment, Mr. MacIntyre was placed in segregation. After his stint was over, jail officials returned him to the general population, the claim alleges. \n \n According to the lawsuit, Mr. Petros, said there would be \"dire consequences\" if he did not remain quiet about the mayor. Mr. Petros was constantly \"in my ear,\" Mr. MacIntyre said in the interview. \n \n \"He was boisterous, overbearing. He was always on me. No matter where I turned, he seemed to be there, like a shadow, constantly,\" Mr. MacIntyre told The Globe. \n \n \"I would just cut him off and say get lost, leave me alone. And then I would sit down to play cards and if I'd stand up, he'd be right on me, in my ear\u2026 He was trying to push himself on me, to intimidate me.\" \n \n In his interview with The Globe, Mr. MacIntyre said he had no recollection of Mr. Petros before his incarceration, except for a phone call that he says the mayor made to Kathy Ford in the summer of 2011, shortly after Mr. Petros was arrested coming out of the home that they had invaded in a search for money and drugs. The mayor was concerned for his former player and he wanted to know whether Mr. MacIntyre had any insight into the implications of Mr. Petros \"ripping somebody off that was supposedly to do with the underworld,\" Mr. MacIntyre said. \"I said I didn't know the guy and didn't want to get involved.\" \n \n Mr. Petros invoked the name of Mr. Aboodowleh, a former assistant coach on Don Bosco who is a friend of Mr. Ford, Mr. MacIntyre said in the interview. Mr. MacIntyre said he has never met Mr. Aboodowleh, who has an extensive record for crimes of violence. The claim also alleges that a video of the mayor ranting about wanting to kill someone, released in November, was filmed at Mr. Aboodowleh's house and was referring to Mr. MacIntyre. \n \n Mr. Morris, the mayor's lawyer, said on behalf of Mr. Ford: \"He denies he was going to kill anybody.\" \n \n Mr. MacIntyre said jailhouse culture prevented him from asking for Mr. Petros to be moved \u2013 \"No, you don't do stuff like that\" \u2013 and that his only choice was to try to get himself removed from the unit. \n \n But before he could, he says he was attacked. On March 22, as Mr. MacIntyre was drying his head with a towel outside the unit's showers, he was assaulted, his lawsuit alleges. He said he could not identify his attackers because of the towel, but he told The Globe he was struck and then brought to the ground with either a tackle or a kick to the leg. \"I heard the snap and I fell on my back,\" he said. \n \n \"It felt like forever, but a good minute and a half in real time. It felt like 10 minutes, but probably a minute, minute and a half.\" \n \n His statement of claim alleges that the attack was executed by \"Petros and another unknown inmate or inmates, or some combination of the foregoing.\" In his interview, he said he could not definitively identify Mr. Petros as the attacker because of the towel but that he is certain Mr. Petros was the mastermind behind the beating. \n \n \"I'm not saying he was the one that assaulted me, because I'm not sure. But I am saying that he was part and parcel of what happened \u2013 because I don't have enemies,\" he said. \"But to have this guy in my ear constantly? One plus one equals two.\" \n \n The area outside the unit's showers where the attack unfolded is normally monitored by a video camera, but the \"video surveillance had been inexplicably disabled\" before the assault, the claim alleges. Immediately after the attack, a guard thrust papers into his face and asked him to explain what had happened, Mr. MacIntyre said. He indicated that he had \"slipped\" in the shower, an explanation that he acknowledges was not true. (Another source from the Toronto West Detention Centre said it was \"implausible\" that Mr. MacIntyre's injuries were the result of falling in the shower.) \n \n He was kept at the jail for 36 hours after the assault, a delay that caused complications in treating his injuries, the claim alleges. At the hospital, where he resided for about two weeks, his leg fracture was repaired with several screws, he said. To this day, Mr. MacIntyre, who has no dental coverage, has been unable to replace his front teeth, he said. \n \n A source with knowledge of the attack on Mr. MacIntyre said the alleged role of a former Don Bosco player, or players, was something that was discussed in at least one court proceeding in the lead-up to Mr. MacIntyre's sentencing. \n \n Mr. MacIntyre alleges that Mr. Petros, Mr. Ford and Mr. Aboodowleh conspired to have him attacked. When Globe reporters asked what evidence existed that Mr. Ford played any role in the attack, Mr. MacIntyre declined to answer, saying he did not want to discuss such evidence in advance of examination for discovery proceedings. \n \n In his interview with The Globe, Mr. MacIntyre said that he was never interviewed by anyone from Toronto police. \n \n In an e-mailed statement, the Ministry of Correctional Services said police were not contacted because \"the individual in question refused to co-operate in any investigation.\" \n \n Mr. Petros did not reply to written requests for an interview, including a letter with detailed questions that was delivered to him through the Correctional Service of Canada. \n \n More than a year before Mr. Petros was incarcerated, he appeared on stage in his Don Bosco jersey at Mr. Ford's 2010 mayoral campaign kickoff at the Toronto Congress Centre. In a video recording posted online by Mr. Ford's campaign team, he is shown standing in the background while Nicholas Swaby, another one of the mayor's former players, described Mr. Ford's contributions. Since that video was put online, Mr. Swaby was charged with aggravated assault in connection with the 2009 murder of Christopher Skinner. When Mr. Petros was sentenced to five years in prison in April 2012, the assistant Crown attorney who prosecuted him described how his victim was bound, stabbed and threatened with a sawed-off Winchester rifle. His victim, the owner of the home Mr. Petros invaded, \"suffered injuries to virtually every part of his body, in addition to extensive swelling and bruising.\" \n \n In his interview with The Globe, Mr. MacIntyre declined to answer many questions about Mr. Ford's use of illegal drugs and alcohol. \n \n \"I have kept my head down, per se, in regards to all this, you know. I'm not talking about personal stuff.\" \n \n With reports from Jill Mahoney, Ann Hui and Elizabeth Church \n \n Statement of claim in the lawsuit against Toronto Mayor Rob Ford, Jan. 29, 2014",
        "Summary": "Rob Ford, the Mayor of Toronto, has been involved in multiple scandals, including a crack scandal and an alleged prostitute scandal. Despite these controversies, he remains in office due to the protection of Ontario's provincial government. Ford's handlers have failed to keep him out of the public eye, leading to further public incidents, such as speaking in a Jamaican accent at a restaurant. Scott MacIntyre, who is related to Ford through his sister Kathy Ford, filed a lawsuit alleging that he was beaten in jail by Aedan Petros, a former football player coached by Ford. MacIntyre claims the beating was orchestrated to keep him quiet about Ford's substance abuse. Ford has denied any involvement in the attack. The lawsuit also names Payman Aboodowleh and the Minister of Correctional Services as defendants. MacIntyre suffered severe injuries from the attack and has a history of drug trafficking and addiction. The case has raised questions about the extent of Ford's influence and the protection he receives from the provincial government.",
