        "Document": "Acidic wastewater from an abandoned mine above Silverton coursed its way through La Plata County on Thursday, turning the Animas River orange-brown, forcing the city of Durango to stop pumping raw water from the river and persuading the sheriff to close the river to public use. \n \n Residents lined the banks of the Animas River on Thursday afternoon to watch the toxic wastewater as it flowed through Durango city limits. But the sludge slowed as it snaked its way through the oxbow in the Animas Valley, and the murk didn't arrive until after 8 p.m. \n \n The accident occurred about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Gold King Mine in San Juan County. A mining and safety team working on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency triggered the discharge, according to a news release issued by the EPA. \n \n The EPA's team was working with heavy equipment to secure and consolidate a safe way to enter the mine and access contaminated water, said Richard Mylott, a spokesman for the EPA in Denver. The project was intended to pump and treat the water and reduce metal pollution flowing out of the mine into Cement Creek, he said. \n \n The disaster released about 1 million gallons of acidic water containing sediment and metals flowing as an orange-colored discharge downstream through Cement Creek and into the Animas River. \n \n River closure \n \n The Animas River was closed to tubers, rafters and kayakers Thursday as the toxic plume made its way through Durango. The closure went into effect at 3 p.m., and it will remain in effect indefinitely until the river is deemed safe, said La Plata County Sheriff Sean Smith. Government officials aren't certain what toxins and at what levels toxins are present in the river, and, therefore, decided it was best to close the river to public use. \n \n The closure, which applies to all flotation devices, is in effect for the entire stretch of the Animas River in La Plata County. \n \n \u201cThis decision was made in the interest of public health after consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, San Juan Basin Health Department and representatives of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEPA test results of the Animas River are expected within 24-48 hours, and the order will be re-evaluated at that time.\u201d \n \n City to conserve water \n \n The city of Durango stopped pumping water out of the Animas River on Wednesday to prevent contaminating the city reservoir. \n \n The Animas is an important secondary source of water for the city during the summer, and residents need to conserve as much water as possible over the next few days until the water is safe to use, said Steve Salka, the city's utilities director. \n \n No formal water restrictions were issued. \n \n At south City Market, Sean Lumen, who was hoisting bottled water onto emptied shelves, said if customers continued to buy water at Thursday's rate, the store would run out sometime Friday. \n \n At Albertsons, front-end manager Shelley Osborn said she initially thought people were buying up bottled water at an unusually rapid rate because it was on sale. Aaron Memro, grocery manager, estimated Albertsons sold two pallets of water Thursday \u2013 far more than usual. \n \n During the emergency, Salka will not send raw water to Hillcrest Golf Club or Fort Lewis College for grounds use. The city also will not water any city-owned parks for the next three days to help conserve, he said. \n \n On hot summer days, the city can use up to 9.2 million gallons a day. But the city can pump only 5.3 million gallons a day out of the Florida River. \n \n The city reservoir was about 4.5 feet below capacity on Wednesday, Salka said. \n \n \u201cThis couldn't happen at a worse time for me, so I have to be really cautious,\u201d he said. \n \n Fish habitat \n \n The EPA downplayed the potential effects on aquatic life, saying there are long-standing water-quality impairment issues associated with heavy metals in Cement Creek and upper portions of the Animas River. As a result, there are no fish populations in the Cement Creek watershed, and fish populations have historically been impaired for several miles downstream of Silverton in the Animas River, the release said. \n \n Colorado Parks and Wildlife placed four cages containing fish in the Animas River to monitor what happens to them, said spokesman Joe Lewandowski. The cages were placed at 32nd Street, the fish hatchery, Dallabetta Park and the High Bridge. \n \n \u201cWe'll see if those fish survive,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cWe're also monitoring to make sure we don't get infiltration into the hatchery, because that could be a problem.\u201d \n \n Peter Butler, co-coordinator of the Animas River Stakeholders Group and former chairman of the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission, said it remains to be seen whether the toxic metal concentrations flowing downriver will impact the few fish species living below Bakers Bridge. But if the plume does have a negative impact on aquatic life, Butler estimated that fish would die within hours of contact with the plume. \n \n The contaminated water made its way to Bakers Bridge in La Plata County by Thursday morning and hit town by Thursday evening. The material was expected to cross the New Mexico state line between 4 and 5 a.m. Friday and arrive in Farmington on Friday evening. \n \n Farmington city officials shut down all water-supply intake pumps to avoid contamination and advised citizens to stay out of the river until the discoloration has passed. \n \n Local officials asked all agricultural water users to shut off water intakes. \n \n What's in the water? \n \n Butler said the water being discharged from Gold King carried high concentrations of iron, aluminum, cadmium, zinc and copper. \n \n While he didn't know precisely the metal levels in the water that surged out of Gold King on Wednesday, Butler said: \u201cI'm sure they were really high.\u201d \n \n Though Gold King has no record of emitting mercury, Butler said \u201cwhen old mines open up like that, mercury sometimes drains out. Possibly, some other metals might have been released, like lead and arsenic. But there's no evidence of that at this point.\u201d \n \n Butler said Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety scientist Kirstin Brown had tested pH levels \u2013 the telltale measure of acidity in water \u2013 in the Animas River at Trimble Lane when the toxic plume arrived. \n \n The pH level dropped from 7.8 to 5.8. \n \n \u201cThat's a pretty big drop,\u201d Butler said. \n \n Silverton does not use water from Cement Creek, so its water source remained uncontaminated, said William Tookey, the San Juan County administrator who met Thursday with EPA officials. \n \n The Animas River was looking healthier about 24 hours after the discharge in Silverton, he said. \n \n Gold King problems \n \n This is not the first time there has been a water-related accident at one of the mines, but it did come as a surprise to the town, Tookey said. \n \n He was not sure if the release would change attitudes toward the EPA in town. For years, some town residents and local officials have been opposed to a Superfund listing. \n \n \u201cSince it was the EPA that was responsible for this, it may make people less likely to be open to them,\u201d he said. \n \n Butler said everyone invested in improving the Animas River's water quality wanted to get into Gold King, because, for years, it has been one of the two biggest contributors of heavy-metal loads in the Animas Basin. \n \n \u201cThey had a plan for handling the mine pool, but something went wrong, and it all came blowing out,\u201d Butler said. \n \n EPA teams will be sampling and investigating downstream locations over the next several days to confirm the release has passed and poses no additional concerns for aquatic life or water users. ||||| DENVER (AP) \u2014 A plume of orange-ish muck from million-gallon mine waste spill in Colorado was headed down river to New Mexico, prompting communities along the water route to take precautions until the sludge passes. \n \n People kayak in the Animas River near Durango, Colo., Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015, in water colored from a mine waste spill. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that a cleanup team was working with... (Associated Press) \n \n Dan Bender, with the La Plata County Sheriff's Office, takes a water sample from the Animas River near Durango, Colo., Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015. The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that a cleanup... (Associated Press) \n \n Officials emphasized that there was no threat to drinking water from the spill. But downstream water agencies were warned to avoid Animas River water until the plume passes, said David Ostrander, director of the EPA's emergency response program in Denver. \n \n The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that a cleanup team was working with heavy equipment Wednesday to secure an entrance to the Gold King Mine in southwest Colorado. Workers instead released an estimated 1 million gallons of mine waste into Cement Creek. \n \n \"The project was intended to pump and treat the water and reduce metals pollution flowing out of the mine,\" agency spokesman Rich Mylott said in a statement. \n \n The creek runs into the Animas, which then flows into the San Juan River in New Mexico and joins the Colorado River in Utah. \n \n Officials weren't sure how long it would take the plume to dissipate, Ostrander said. The acidic sludge is made of heavy metal and soil, which could irritate the skin, he said. \n \n The EPA was testing the plume to see which metals were released. Previous contamination from the mine sent iron, aluminum, cadmium, zinc and copper into the water, said Peter Butler, co-coordinator of the Animas River Stakeholders Group. \n \n Earlier Thursday, the EPA said in a statement that the polluted water \"was held behind unconsolidated debris near an abandoned mine portal.\" \n \n As the plume headed toward New Mexico, that state's governor said the EPA waited too long to tell her about the problem. \n \n Gov. Susana Martinez is disturbed by the lack of information provided by the agency to New Mexico's environmental agencies, said Chris Sanchez, a spokesman for the governor. Sanchez said that the state was not told of the spill until almost a full day after it happened. \n \n The plume made its way to Durango on Thursday afternoon, prompting La Plata County health officials to warn rafters and others to avoid the water. The scenic waterway was the backdrop for parts of the movie \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and is popular with summer boaters. \n \n Durango stopped pumping water out of the Animas River on Wednesday to make sure none of the waste could be sucked up into the city reservoir. It also suspended the transfers of raw water to a local golf course and Fort Lewis College. Pet owners were advised to keep dogs and livestock out of the Animas. \n \n \"It's really, really ugly,\" Butch Knowlton, La Plata County's director of emergency preparedness, told The Durango Herald. \"Any kind of recreational activity on the river needs to be suspended.\" \n \n In Farmington, New Mexico, city officials shut down water-supply intake pumps to avoid contamination and advised citizens to stay out of the river until the discoloration has passed. Don Cooper, emergency manager in San Juan County, said people should not panic because the EPA had told the county the spill would not harm people and that the primary pollutants were iron and zinc. \n \n \"It's not going to look pretty, but it's not a killer,\" Cooper told The (Farmington) Daily Times. \n \n The impact on wildlife wasn't clear. There are no fish in the Cement Creek watershed because of longstanding problems with water quality, the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment said. \n \n Colorado Parks and Wildlife was placing cages containing fish in the Animas River to monitor what happens to them, spokesman Joe Lewandowski said. \n \n \"We'll see if those fish survive,\" Lewandowski said. \"We're also monitoring to make sure we don't get infiltration into the hatchery, because that could be a problem.\" \n \n The U.S. Fish & Wildlife office in suburban Denver did not immediately return a call asking about the spill. \n \n Durango resident Lisa Shaefer said she was near the mine Wednesday when a mine bulwark broke and sent a torrent of water downstream that raised the water level 2 to 3 feet in Cement Creek. The initial wall of water carried rocks and debris and made a roar as it pushed through a culvert, she said. \n \n \"What came down was the filthiest yellow mustard water you've ever seen,\" she told the newspaper. \n \n ___ \n \n Information from: KIQX-FM, http://www.radiodurango.com ||||| About 1 million gallons of mine waste spilled into a Colorado waterway on Wednesday, turning the water bright orange and prompting officials to warn residents to avoid recreational use of the Animas River. \n \n San Juan County health officials say the Environmental Protection Agency and the state Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety were investigating another contamination when they \u201cunexpectedly triggered a large release of mine waste water into the upper portions of Cement Creek.\u201d Cement Creek is a tributary of the Animas River. \n \n Residents in parts of Colorado have been urged to cut back on water use and avoid the Animas River until officials are sure the river is free from contamination.

        "Document": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) \u2013 A Trader Joe\u2019s store assistant manager was killed by gunfire from Los Angeles police officers during a chase and shootout with a suspect in Silver Lake Saturday. \n \n LAPD Chief Michel Moore told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that investigators have determined that one of two officers accidentally shot 27-year-old Melyda Corado while engaging in a shootout with the suspect, 28-year-old Gene Evin Atkins. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry to report that we\u2019ve now determined through our forensic investigation, that one of the officers\u2019 rounds struck Ms. Corado as she was exiting the market and was in close proximity to Atkins,\u201d Moore said. \u201cMs. Corado ran back into the store and collapsed behind the manager\u2019s desk.\u201d \n \n According to Moore, Atkins\u2019 car had slammed into a light pole outside the entrance of the Trader Joe\u2019s, located in the 2700 block of Hyperion Avenue. \n \n Upon hearing the crash, Corado was one of several people who ran to the front door of the store, at the same time that an armed Akins himself ran towards the entrance. \n \n \u201cAs he did so, witness statements and physical evidence from the scene support that Atkins fired multiple rounds from a semiautomatic pistol at the officers,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThe two Los Angeles police officers who had been pursuing Atkins returned fire in defense of their lives and to protect Atkins from harming other individuals.\u201d \n \n The officers fired eight rounds in returning Atkins\u2019 gunshots, Moore said. \n \n The fatal bullet first hit Corado\u2019s arm, then entered her body. \n \n Atkins appeared in court Tuesday to face more than 30 charges, including one count of murder, six counts of attempted murder, 13 counts of false imprisonment of hostages and one count of felony evading. His arraignment was postponed to Aug. 14. His bail was set at $18.7 million. \n \n The slaying is attributed to Atkins even though he did not fire the fatal bullet because he is held to have caused the entire situation. \n \n Moore also released dash-cam video leading up to the chase. Watch it below. \n \n Before Saturday\u2019s shootout at Trader Joe\u2019s, Atkins allegedly shot and wounded his grandmother, who remains hospitalized, and 17-year-old girlfriend. He then led police on a chase, ending at the store. \n \n The Trader Joe\u2019s store remained closed Monday, while a memorial of signs and flowers in memory of Corado continued to grow outside the building. \n \n Although Atkins was booked on suspicion of murder, he could potentially face charges including attempted murder for the roughly 1:30 p.m. Saturday shooting of his 76-year-old grandmother \u2014 Mary Elizabeth Madison \u2014 in the home they shared in the 1600 block of East 32nd Street. Authorities said the woman was shot as many as seven times and remains hospitalized in critical condition. \n \n Atkins\u2019 cousin, Charleo Egland, said she didn\u2019t know exactly what prompted the shooting, but said the grandmother did not want Atkins\u2019 girlfriend in the home, and that likely led to a fight that ended with the shooting. \n \n Police said Atkins\u2019 girlfriend was also wounded in the shooting, and Atkins forced her into his grandmother\u2019s car then drove away with her in the passenger seat. \n \n Using a LoJack system, police traced the 2015 Toyota Camry sedan to the Hollywood area and gave chase, leading to Silver Lake, where Atkins crashed the Toyota into a power pole around 3:30 p.m. in front of the Trader Joe\u2019s supermarket, Moore said. \n \n Atkins got out of the car and ran into the store, firing toward officers as he ran, police said. \n \n A short time later, a woman now known to be Corado was seen being dragged away from the store\u2019s entryway and then unsuccessfully treated by paramedics trying to revive her. \n \n Moore said about 40 people were in the store when Atkins entered. As Atkins ran inside, employees and customers inside scrambled for cover. \n \n Some were seen escaping through a window toward the rear of the business and crawling down a ladder to safety. \n \n Police were also seen carrying several children away from the building. \n \n Atkins\u2019 girlfriend, who had been in the passenger seat of the Toyota when it crashed in front of the store, was taken to a hospital in fair condition. Fire officials described her as a 20-year-old woman. \n \n Police amassed outside the store, and around 5:30 p.m., at least three people who appeared to be customers came out of the store with their hands in the air \u2014 apparently hostages who were released or shoppers who had managed to elude the gunman. \n \n Atkins surrendered at about 6:30 p.m. He was taken to a hospital to be treated for a gunshot wound to his left arm. \n \n Margaret Stewart of the Los Angeles Fire Department said paramedics treated 10 people at the scene of the Trader Joe\u2019s, including Atkins, his girlfriend and Corado. A 12-year-old boy, a 41-year-old woman, a 70-year- old woman and an 81-year-old woman were hospitalized with minor injuries and listed in fair condition, Stewart said. Three other people were evaluated, but declined to be taken to hospitals. \n \n Moore returned to the crime scene Tuesday to be among the mourners. \n \n \u201cThis is about, frankly, an opportunity to pay some respects to a family and to a loss,\u201d Moore said, appearing to become emotional at times. \u201cThis young lady, by every description, had so much to live for, and to a father that has lost, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s (indescribable).\u201d \n \n Reaction to the revelation that officers had accidentally killed Corado was mixed. \n \n \u201cI kind of blame the police because they were shooting directly towards the store,\u201d nearby business owner Peter Hakopyan said. \n \n Hakopyan told CBS2 he knew Corado and witnessed the shootout. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a grocery, and there\u2019s people around,\u201d Hakopyan added. \u201cI would think the police would have more restraint.\u201d \n \n Still, some appreciated the precarious situation in which the officers found themselves. \n \n \u201cThe police did what they felt they had to do in the moment. They couldn\u2019t know,\u201d said longtime Silver Lake resident Miranda Birch. \u201cI think it\u2019s tragic, but I think it\u2019s a mistake to blame the police.\u201d \n \n A GoFundMe page set up to help cover Corado\u2019s funeral expenses had raised nearly $25,000 as of midday Monday. \n \n (\u00a92018 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

But a State Department official said that the fact the money wasn't transferred on Jan. 1 doesn't mean it was frozen. \"There are still deliberations taking place, and we have until mid January to decide what we are going to do,\u201d the official said. \n \n The Trump administration has frozen $125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, according to three Western diplomats who were informed of the move. They said the funding, one third of the annual U.S. donations to the agency, was supposed to be transferred by Jan. 1 but was withheld. \n \n The details: The diplomats, who asked to speak on conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the funding was frozen until the Trump administration finishes its review of U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. \n \n The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway \"in light of the Palestinians' recent conduct.\" \n \n The diplomats added that U.S. officials told U.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to $180 million, which amounts to half of the U.S. funding to UNRWA. \n \n The impact: The Western diplomats said freezing or cutting of such a big part of the U.S. funding would be catastrophic for the organization, would hamper its work and might lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. \n \n U.N. secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has spoken with senior U.S. official about the UNRWA funding and also consulted with foreign ministers from other donor countries, according to the diplomats. \n \n The Israeli security establishment and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories \u2014 the Israeli organization that oversees government activities in the West Bank and Gaza \u2014 are concerned about possible freezing or cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, fearing the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n \n \u201cThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is complicated enough and harming UNRWA funding will only make it more complicated,\" a senior Israeli security official told me. \n \n What we're hearing: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not enthusiastic about the cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, but is politically pressed by conservative ministers in his cabinet and by the fact he can't be more dovish on the Palestinian issue than President Trump. \n \n Officials in the prime minister's office told diplomats from several western countries that Israel does not object to the cutting of U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority, but prefers that the U.S. doesn't cut funding to UNRWA due to the fact it also serves Israeli security interests. \n \n A senior Israeli official told me Netanyahu is in touch with the White House on the UNRWA funding issue, and conveyed the message that Israel prefers \u201cgradual disengagement\" with UNRWA by the U.S. and not a big funding cut. \n \n The prime minister's office said in a statement: \"Netanyahu supports President Trump's critical attitude towards UNRWA and believes practical steps need to be taken in order to change the fact that UNRWA is being used to entrench the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it.\" ||||| This is the full text of the Articles of Impeachment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee on July 27, 1974. \n \n Note: The articles of impeachment were passed only by the Committee on the Judiciary. They were never voted on in the full House of Representatives. Nixon was not impeached. \n \n Article 1 RESOLVED, That Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanours, and that the following articles of impeachment to be exhibited to the Senate: ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT EXHIBITED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN THE NAME OF ITSELF AND OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AGAINST RICHARD M. NIXON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT OF ITS IMPEACHMENT AGAINST HIM FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS. ARTICLE 1 In his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his consitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice, in that: On June 17, 1972, and prior thereto, agents of the Committee for the Re-election of the President committed unlawful entry of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, District of Columbia, for the purpose of securing political intelligence. Subsequent thereto, Richard M. Nixon, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede, and obstruct the investigation of such illegal entry; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities. The means used to implement this course of conduct or plan included one or more of the following: making false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; withholding relevant and material evidence or information from lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counselling witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings; interfering or endeavouring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, and Congressional Committees; approving, condoning, and acquiescing in, the surreptitious payment of substantial sums of money for the purpose of obtaining the silence or influencing the testimony of witnesses, potential witnesses or individuals who participated in such unlawful entry and other illegal activities; endeavouring to misuse the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency of the United States; disseminating information received from officers of the Department of Justice of the United States to subjects of investigations conducted by lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, for the purpose of aiding and assisting such subjects in their attempts to avoid criminal liability; making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted with respect to allegations of misconduct on the part of personnel of the executive branch of the United States and personnel of the Committee for the Re-election of the President, and that there was no involvement of such personnel in such misconduct: or endeavouring to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favoured treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony. In all of this, Richard M. Nixon has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore Richard M. Nixon, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office. Adopted 27-11 by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, at 7.07pm on Saturday, 27th July, 1974, in Room 2141 of the Rayburn Office Building, Washington D.C. Listen to the roll call of the Judiciary Committee on the First Article of Impeachment: \n \n \n \n Listen to the Announcement of the Vote: \n \n \n \n Article 2 Using the powers of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purposed of these agencies. This conduct has included one or more of the following: He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavoured to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposed not authorized by law, and to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be intitiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner. He misused the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, and other executive personnel, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, by directing or authorizing such agencies or personnel to conduct or continue electronic surveillance or other investigations for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; he did direct, authorize, or permit the use of information obtained thereby for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; and he did direct the concealment of certain records made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of electronic surveillance. He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, authorized and permitted to be maintained a secret investigative unit within the office of the President, financed in part with money derived from campaign contributions, which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged in covert and unlawful activities, and attempted to prejudice the constitutional right of an accused to a fair trial. He has failed to take care that the laws were faithfully executed by failing to act when he knew or had reason to know that his close subordinates endeavoured to impede and frustrate lawful inquiries by duly constituted executive, judicial and legislative entities concerning the unlawful entry into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, and the cover-up thereof, and concerning other unlawful activities including those relating to the confirmation of Richard Kleindienst as Attorney General of the United States, the electronic surveillance of private citizens, the break-in into the offices of Dr. Lewis Fielding, and the campaign financing practices of the Committee to Re-elect the President.

In all of this, Richard M.

He added that Trump \"has every right to express his view of any case.\" \n \n The latter comment refers to Trump's tweets dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. Most recently, Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser and campaign aide, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI, and one day later, Trump's Twitter account posted a comment that could help bolster a case of obstruction: \n \n \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\u201d Trump posted, the first time he suggested he knew Flynn lied to investigators. \n \n The tweet could be seen as evidence of obstruction of justice because Trump later reportedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to \u201clet\u201d the Flynn thing \u201cgo.\" \n \n Dowd said that he wrote the tweet. Not that it matters, because the president can't be found guilty of obstruction, the lawyer claims. \n \n It\u2019s not clear which section of the Constitution's Article II Dowd was referencing, though Section Two does read: \u201c The president] may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\u201d \n \n Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now \n \n But according to Dowd, the tweet was the furthest thing from an admission of guilt or obstruction. \n \n \"The tweet did not admit obstruction. That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion,\u201d Dowd told Axios. \n \n Dowd\u2019s comments hark back to former President Richard Nixon\u2019s defense of his actions in office. Nixon, who resigned in August 1974 before he could be impeached, famously said during his interviews with British journalist David Frost in 1977 that \u201cwhen the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\u201d \n \n REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan \n \n In Nixon\u2019s case, he was talking about the cover-up in the Watergate scandal, while Trump\u2019s case involves the president\u2019s powers over the Justice Department. Trump lamented in November that the \u201csaddest thing\u201d about being president is that he is \u201cnot supposed to be involved with the Justice Department\u201d and the \u201cFBI.\u201d \n \n Trump then asked why the Justice Department was not going after his former presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her private email server scandal. He also wondered why the department was not investigating Clinton\u2019s campaign for hiring the company that created the infamous Trump-Russia dossier that has dogged Trump\u2019s first year in office.",
        "Summary": "The President of the United States holds office for four years and is elected with the Vice President. The President is the commander in chief of the Army and Navy and can be removed by impeachment for high crimes and misdemeanors. Electors are appointed by state legislatures and vote for two persons. The President of the Senate opens the certificates of votes, and the House of Representatives chooses the President if there is no majority in electoral votes, while the Senate chooses the Vice President in such a case. Congress determines the time of choosing electors and provides for the case of removal, death, resignation, or inability of the President and Vice President. The Trump administration froze $125 million in funding for UNRWA, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, and is reviewing U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority, which suspended contacts with the Trump administration. Richard M. Nixon was impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors but resigned before the impeachment vote. John Dowd claimed that the President cannot obstruct justice. Michael Flynn pleaded guilty to lying to the FBI, and Trump reportedly asked James Comey to let the Flynn investigation go.",

        "Document": "404 Not found \n \n \u2014 Police are asking property owners in this city and throughout nearby rural Albemarle County to look for any signs of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, hoping that they can locate her after nearly two weeks of searching. \n \n Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy J. Longo said during a news conference Thursday that searchers have combed through most of this college town and are now moving south into surrounding farms and woodland. He also urged real estate agents and others to look in and around vacant homes and buildings in an effort to find the 18-year-old, who has been missing since Sept. 13. \n \n Longo said Graham had an iPhone 5S with a pink case that has not been found, and he said people should report anything they see that seems out of the ordinary on their properties, including unexpected tire tracks, clothing or other evidence that might help police find her. \n \n \u201cWe have no idea where she is, despite our best efforts,\u201d Longo said. \u201cEveryone realizes the more time that goes by, the more difficult this is going to come for everyone. I can\u2019t lose hope until I have to, until I need to, until it\u2019s appropriate to transition this into some other type of operation. I have hope, and I think Hannah\u2019s mom and dad have hope.\u201d \n \n Longo said in an interview Thursday that he wants anyone who knows Jesse L. \u201cLJ\u201d Matthew Jr., 32, who is charged with abducting Graham, to help identify spots that Matthew frequented. Police asked for help finding \u00adplaces where Matthew likes to fish, for example. A reward of $100,000 is being offered for information leading to the safe return of the 18-year-old U-Va. sophomore from Fairfax County. \n \n Charlottesville investigators arrived Thursday in Galveston, Tex., where Matthew appeared in court after he was arrested on a beach Wednesday afternoon. Longo said Charlottesville police will not approach Matthew about the case because he has invoked his right to consult with an attorney. Local authorities said they would try to speak with him late Thursday or early Friday, and they were searching his car for evidence. \n \n Matthew is the last person known to have seen Graham, and he has been charged with abduction with intent to sexually assault her. Police have not detailed what evidence they have against him. Matthew was taken into custody Wednesday in Texas after a widespread manhunt, and police said he will be extradited to Charlottesville to face charges in her disappearance. \n \n Early Thursday, Matthew appeared briefly in a Texas courtroom, where a judge denied bond and read Matthew his rights. Matthew declined a court- \n \n appointed attorney and waived an extradition hearing. \n \n Charlottesville lawyer James L. Camblos III, who is representing Matthew, said that he spoke to Matthew by phone late Wednesday, after his arrest. \n \n \u201cHe sounded okay considering the circumstances,\u201d Camblos said. \u201cHe called me from the jail and, under the circumstances, he sounded pretty good.\u201d \n \n Longo said it is unclear why Matthew was in the Galveston area, a popular summer destination on the Gulf of Mexico southeast of Houston and about 1,300 miles from Charlottesville. A Galveston County deputy found Matthew after the sheriff\u2019s office received a call from a woman who saw Matthew on the beach \u2014 in Gilchrist, on the Bolivar Peninsula \u2014 and found him suspicious. \n \n The deputy noticed that Matthew had set up a tent on the beach, sheriff\u2019s Capt. Barry Cook said. Matthew initially gave a false name, but the deputy ran the license plates on Matthew\u2019s car and discovered that he was wanted in Virginia, Cook said. Matthew was taken into custody without incident. \n \n [See a map of the region where Matthew was apprehended.] \n \n Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset said Thursday that deputies have examined the car and surrounding sand dunes and will widen their search, but that they have no indication of where Graham might be. \n \n \u201cThis individual has a 1,300-mile track,\u201d the sheriff said, referring to Matthew\u2019s trip from Charlottesville to east Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of area to look at.\u201d \n \n It is unclear what ties, if any, Matthew might have to Texas. He grew up in the Charlottesville area and attended two Virginia universities \u2014 Liberty from 2000 to 2002 and then Christopher Newport in 2003. He played football at both schools and left both schools. Officials at the school would not discuss the circumstances of his departure, citing privacy rules. \n \n Also on Thursday, the owner of the restaurant where Graham was last seen said that Graham never entered the establishment with her alleged abductor, instead waiting outside for him while he purchased drinks. \n \n Brice Cunningham, owner of the upscale Tempo Restaurant in Charlottesville, said he saw Matthew for the first time at the restaurant late on Friday, Sept. 12, and then again during the early hours of Sept. 13. Cunningham said that Matthew drank shots of bourbon with two other customers about 11:45 p.m., and that he then saw Matthew enjoying music on the restaurant\u2019s dance floor. \n \n Cunningham said that Matthew, who was not a regular at the bar, appeared to be having a good time that evening. \n \n \u201cHe wasn\u2019t aggressive, he wasn\u2019t unpleasant,\u201d said Cunningham, 43. \u201cHe seemed friendly and was talking to people.\u201d \n \n Cunningham said that Matthew left the bar briefly and returned just after 1 a.m., closed a tab for two beers at 1:10 a.m. and then left sometime after that. He said that Tempo staffers, who were checking identification to ensure that patrons were at least 21 years old, saw Graham outside the bar and thought she appeared intoxicated. They saw her leave with Matthew on foot. \n \n \u201cNone of my staff saw her inside that night,\u201d Cunningham said in an interview Thursday. In a statement, Cunningham said that Graham was not served alcohol. \u201cShe was, however, noticed by the door person outside the restaurant at that time, and seen leaving with Matthew shortly thereafter.\u201d \n \n Graham had been seen on surveillance video walking with Matthew shortly after 1 a.m. on the city\u2019s Downtown Mall, headed in the direction of Tempo. Friends said her last text to them was at 1:06 a.m., just minutes before Matthew got to Tempo. The owner\u2019s account suggests that Graham arrived at the restaurant with Matthew, waited for him outside, and then left with him. \n \n The account differs from what police have said about Graham\u2019s interactions with Matthew at Tempo. Longo said Thursday that his investigators \u201chave at least one witness statement that puts Hannah Graham inside the bar with Mr. Matthew. You\u2019re always evaluating witness statements in an ongoing investigation, and we will be talking to folks again, but we have that statement.\u201d \n \n An extensive search has turned up almost no trace of Graham after she was seen at Tempo. Police have collected evidence from Matthew\u2019s car and apartment, and Longo said that prosecutors decided to press charges against Matthew after reviewing evidence from experts at the crime lab in Richmond. The charge against Matthew suggests that police believe Matthew took Graham against her will \u2014 or while she was in a state that left her unable to consent. \n \n Those close to Matthew, who is 6-foot-2 and weighs 270 pounds, have said they know him as a \u201cgentle giant\u201d who prayed at a local church, worked at the U-Va. hospital caring for patients and volunteered at the private Covenant School as a football coach. \n \n Flaherty and Jouvenal reported from Washington. ||||| Thank you for Reading. \n \n Please purchase a subscription to continue reading. \n \n A subscription is required to continue reading. \n \n Thank you for reading 5 free articles.

(Associated Press) \n \n Jill Howard, left, and her stepdaughter Martie Belt, talk about the arrest of Leroy Matthew Jr. as they walk along the beach Thursday, Sept. 25, 2014, near Gilchrist, Texas, on the Bolivar Peninsula.... (Associated Press) \n \n The island's beaches have served as a hiding spot for centuries: graves from one of the Houston area's most notorious mass slayings and a haven for the famed French pirate Jean Lafitte. \n \n \"We seem to be the end of the road,\" Sheriff Henry Trochesset said. \n \n Matthew was arrested Wednesday as a suspect in the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham. He waived extradition Thursday in Galveston. \n \n His arrest \u2014 initially for refusing to identify himself to authorities \u2014 came after a phone tip from a resident who saw the 6-foot-2, 270-pound man with dreadlocks and recognized him from TV. A deputy then spotted him camped out on the beach. \n \n It's not uncommon to see random tents on the barren beaches, nor for sheriff's deputies to encounter people who don't want to identify themselves, Trochesset said. \n \n \"We get lots of weird folks,\" Rob Faupel, 45, an air conditioning technician, said. \"It seems like a good place to seek refuge. It's kind of remote.\" \n \n Only one road leads to the peninsula from the mainland to the east, a two-lane state highway south of Interstate 10 that ends at the Gulf of Mexico and heads west toward Galveston. Repeated storms wiped out the old highway Texas 87 that bordered the seashore and led to Port Arthur and Beaumont at the far southeast corner of the state. Motorists coming from Galveston and Houston must take a 20-minute ferry ride across Galveston Bay. \n \n As far as the campers, beach maintenance crew member Cliff Reichel said, \"We don't bother them unless they flat out are doing something wrong.\" \n \n Reichel, 62, of Galveston, recalled one woman who was noteworthy because she had puppets on stakes outside her tent. She stayed for five months, then abruptly left. \n \n \"You get people who stay a month at a time, a week at a time,\" his partner, Jacob Huffstetler, 25, of nearby High Island, added. \n \n Becky Sosa, who works at Miss Nancy's Bait Camp in Gilchrist not far from the beach, agreed that Matthew might have easily gone unnoticed. \n \n \"He would fit right in,\" said the 54-year-old Sosa. \"We get some strange ones that come through here. Some have stayed. It's like a magnet.\" \n \n She thought it was possible that Matthew had bought cigarettes from her on Tuesday, but she couldn't be sure because it was a busy day with fishing customers. \"I would have thought nothing about it,\" she added. \n \n In the early 1970s, authorities recovered seven bodies from a Bolivar beach at High Island, one of three mass graves used by serial killer Dean Corll. His 28-victim killing spree ended when accomplice Elmer Wayne Henley Jr. killed him in August 1973. \n \n \"It's kind of scary,\" Jill Howard, 56, of Arlington, said, recalling the infamous killings while walking the beach Thursday with her stepdaughter. But she said she could understand how someone trying to avoid capture would head out to \"this beach out in the boonies.\"",
        "Summary": "Police are asking property owners in Charlottesville and nearby Albemarle County to look for signs of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, who has been missing since Sept. 13. Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy J. Longo said searchers have combed through the college town and are now moving into surrounding areas. He urged real estate agents to check vacant homes. Graham was last seen with Jesse L. Matthew Jr., who has been charged with her abduction and was arrested in Galveston, Texas. Matthew waived his extradition hearing and is represented by James L. Camblos III. Brice Cunningham, owner of Tempo Restaurant, where Graham was last seen, said she never entered the establishment but was seen leaving with Matthew. Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset said deputies examined Matthew's car and the surrounding area but found no indication of Graham's location. Matthew attended Liberty and Christopher Newport Universities and is described by those who know him as a 'gentle giant.'",

NASA or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Yet in many cases, their contributions are unknown or under-appreciated \u2014 especially as women have historically struggled to gain acceptance in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). \n \n \n \n This proposed set celebrates five notable NASA pioneers and provides an educational building experience to help young ones and adults alike learn about the history of women in STEM. The five Women of NASA are: ||||| For years, Maia Weinstock, the deputy editor of MIT News, has been creating miniature LEGO figurines to honor and promote such scientists and engineers as MIT Institute Professor Emerita Mildred Dresselhaus, Vice President for Research Maria T. Zuber, and Department of Chemical Engineering head Paula Hammond, the David H. Koch Chair Professor in Engineering. The figures are Weinstock\u2019s playful way of boosting the visibility of scientists, in particular the work of female scientists. \n \n Now, a set of LEGOs Weinstock created celebrating the history of women at NASA is about to blast off. On Tuesday, LEGO announced that Weinstock\u2019s project, which spotlights five women who made historic contributions to the U.S. space program, has been selected to become an official LEGO set. \n \n \u201cWhat a wonderful way to celebrate the scientific achievements of these five pioneering women,\ufffd? says Zuber, the E.A. Griswold Professor of Geophysics and the first woman to lead a NASA planetary mission. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thrilled with the message that these LEGOs will send to girls \u2014 that they, too, can pursue their passions in science, technology, engineering, and math, and help make a better world.\ufffd? \n \n Last summer Weinstock submitted her concept, dubbed the Women of NASA, to LEGO Ideas, a platform that allows people around the world to propose new ideas for LEGO concepts. After a public voting period, during which Weinstock\u2019s set received 10,000 votes in 15 days, her project underwent an official LEGO review. \n \n Weinstock was inspired to create the set by her love of space and NASA, and her desire to showcase the contributions that women have made over the years to the field of space exploration. Above all, she hopes the set will help encourage more young girls to pursue STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math). \n \n \u201cI hope that \u2018Women of NASA\u2019 will be one little extra brick in the wall of trying to improve how women are perceived and shown in books, toys, and family programming,\ufffd? Weinstock explains. \u201cAnything I can do to help make sure girls understand that they can and should be interested in the sciences, engineering, and math, that is my goal. At the end of the day, that\u2019s why I am doing this.\ufffd? \n \n The set depicts five trailblazers in NASA\u2019s history: Margaret Hamilton, a computer scientist who led the development of software for the Apollo missions while at MIT; Mae Jemison, who became the first African-American woman in space in 1992; Katherine Johnson, known for calculating and verifying trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo programs; Sally Ride, who became the first American woman in space in 1983; and astronomer Nancy Grace Roman, one of the first female executives at NASA, who was instrumental in the planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. \n \n Weinstock explains that she wanted the set to feature \u201ca very diverse group of women in terms of what they did, in terms of their fields at NASA, in terms of their cultural backgrounds, and also in terms of their age. Some are shown as younger, but I made sure I had one shown as older. Also, most of the women in the set are known for their work in the space flight program at NASA, but I wanted to give a shout out to the astronomy program as well.\ufffd? \n \n Weinstock began creating LEGO figures back in 2009, when she constructed a LEGO likeness for her friend Carolyn Porco, a planetary scientist known for her imaging work on the Voyager and Cassini missions. After sharing an image of Porco\u2019s LEGO figurine on Twitter, Weinstock received an outpouring of positive feedback and was inspired to create more figures in an effort to help promote the work of living scientists. \n \n Since she built her first figurine, Weinstock has created LEGOs for a number of celebrated scientists and engineers, including primatologist Jane Goodall, oceanographer Sylvia Earle, physicist Stephen Hawking, and a number of MIT faculty members such as Ernest Moniz, professor of physics and special advisor to the president, and Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a member of MIT\u2019s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. \n \n \u201cBeing immortalized in LEGO is probably the coolest thing that has ever happened to me,\ufffd? Bhatia says. \u201cI hope it makes lots of little tinkerers dream about being engineers at MIT someday.\ufffd? \n \n Weinstock explains that she chose LEGOs as her medium as she feels \u201cthere is a childlike wonder to playing with a toy that you can make in people\u2019s likeness.\ufffd? \n \n \u201cOne major goal for me is to get the public to recognize the history of women in the STEM fields. I\u2019m hopeful that with this set more people will come to know these women,\ufffd? Weinstock says. \u201cPart of it is knowing these specific five women, but also part of it is setting an example. It\u2019s really important to set an example for girls, as well as for boys, to normalize and make plain that women are expected to be in these fields and that it\u2019s not strange or unusual.\ufffd?",

'This thing that was my best friend for a long time suddenly turned on me,' she said of the notorious Hollywood machine. 'And I didn\u00ef\u00bf\u00bdt expect it.

Really not,\" said Cassavetes. \"And Ryan came to me, and there's 150 people standing in this big scene, and he says, 'Nick, come here.' And he's doing a scene with Rachel and he says, 'Would you take her out of here and bring in another actress to read off-camera with me?' I said, 'What?' He says, 'I can't. I can't do it with her. I'm just not getting anything from this.\" \n \n Apparently, the only thing that calmed the feud between the lead actors was more fighting. \n \n \"We went into a room with a producer; they started screaming and yelling at each other. I walked out,\" Cassavetes recalled. \"At that point I was smoking cigarettes. I smoked a cigarette and everybody came out like, 'All right, let's do this.' And it got better after that, you know? They had it out. The rest of the film wasn't smooth sailing, but it was smoother sailing.\" \n \n In a 2007 interview with The Observer, Gosling opened up about his rocky relationship with McAdams. \n \n \"We inspired the worst in each other. It was a strange experience, making a love story and not getting along with your co-star in any way,\" Gosling said. \n \n Somehow, the tension between the pair led to a real-life romantic relationship. Gosling himself seems confused by how that came to be. \n \n \"I don't know what happened,\" he told The Observer. \"Two years later I saw her in New York and we started getting the idea that maybe we were wrong about each other ...\" Gosling trailed off. \n \n Gosling and McAdams dated on and off until they finally called it quits in 2007. In the couple's volatile fashion, Gosling told GQ in 2007 that the two didn't break up without a fight. \n \n \u201cThe only thing I remember is we both went down swingin\u2019 and we called it a draw,\" Gosling said. \n \n Guess love really isn't like the movies.",

Fatalities caused by war, directly and indirectly, amount to 470,000, according to the Syrian Centre for Policy Research (SCPR) \u2013 a far higher total than the figure of 250,000 used by the United Nations until it stopped collecting statistics 18 months ago. \n \n In all, 11.5% of the country\u2019s population have been killed or injured since the crisis erupted in March 2011, the report estimates. The number of wounded is put at 1.9 million. Life expectancy has dropped from 70 in 2010 to 55.4 in 2015. Overall economic losses are estimated at $255bn (\u00a3175bn). \n \n Russia offers ceasefire in Syria but US suspects ploy to crush rebels Read more \n \n The stark account of the war\u2019s toll came as warnings multiplied about Aleppo, Syria\u2019s largest city, which is in danger of being cut off by a government advance aided by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militiamen. The Syrian opposition is demanding urgent action to relieve the suffering of tens of thousands of civilians. \n \n The International Red Cross said on Wednesday that 50,000 people had fled the upsurge in fighting in the north, requiring urgent deliveries of food and water. \n \n Talks in Munich on Thursday between the US secretary of state, John Kerry, and his Russian counterpart, Sergei Lavrov, will be closely watched for any sign of an end to the deadly impasse. UN-brokered peace talks in Geneva are scheduled to resume in two weeks but are unlikely to do so without a significant shift of policy. \n \n Speaking in London on Wednesday, an opposition spokesman, Salim al-Muslet, said President Barack Obama could stop the Russian attacks. \u201cIf he is willing to save our children it is really the time now to say \u2018no\u2019 to these strikes in Syria,\u201d he said. The Washington Post reported that Moscow had sent a letter to Washington proposing to stop bombing on 1 March. \n \n Of the 470,000 war dead counted by the SCPR, about 400,000 were directly due to violence, while the remaining 70,000 fell victim to lack of adequate health services, medicine, especially for chronic diseases, lack of food, clean water, sanitation and proper housing, especially for those displaced within conflict zones. \n \n \u201cWe use very rigorous research methods and we are sure of this figure,\u201d Rabie Nasser, the report\u2019s author, told the Guardian. \u201cIndirect deaths will be greater in the future, though most NGOs [non-governmental organisations] and the UN ignore them. \n \n \u201cWe think that the UN documentation and informal estimation underestimated the casualties due to lack of access to information during the crisis,\u201d he said. \n \n Humanitarian efforts in Aleppo are at breaking point \u2013 this war has to end | Dalia Al-Awqati Read more \n \n In statistical terms, Syria\u2019s mortality rate increase from 4.4 per thousand in 2010 to 10.9 per thousand in 2015. \n \n The UN high commissioner for human rights \u2013 which manages conflict death tolls \u2013 stopped counting Syria\u2019s dead in mid-2014, citing lack of access and diminishing confidence in data sources. \n \n The SCPR was based until recently in Damascus and research for this and previous reports was carried out on the ground across Syria. It is careful not to criticise the Syrian government or its allies \u2013 Iran, Hezbollah, Russia. And with the exception of Islamic State, it refers only to \u201carmed groups\u201d seeking to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad. But despite the neutral tone the findings are shocking. \n \n In an atmosphere of \u201ccoercion, fear and fanaticism\u201d, blackmail, theft and smuggling have supported the continuation of armed conflict so that the Syrian economy has become \u201ca black hole\u201d absorbing \u201cdomestic and external resources\u201d.Oil production continues to be an \u201cimportant financial resource\u201d for Isis and other armed groups, it says. \n \n Consumer prices rose 53% last year. But suffering is unevenly spread. \u201cPrices in conflict zones and besieged areas are much higher than elsewhere in the country and this boosts profit margins for war traders who monopolise the markets of these regions,\u201d it says. Employment conditions and pay have deteriorated and women work less because of security concerns. About 13.8 million Syrians have lost their source of livelihood. \n \n Madaya again facing starvation as report warns of extent of sieges Read more \n \n \u201cThe common characteristics across all regions are lack of security, the allocation of all resources to the fighting, the creation of violence-related job opportunities and imposition of authority by force.\u201d \n \n The shrinking of the population by 21% helps explain the waves of refugees reaching Turkey and Europe. In all, 45% of the population have been displaced, 6.36 million internally and more than 4 million abroad. Health, education and income standards have all deteriorated sharply.

(Associated Press) \n \n MUNICH (AP) \u2014 Russia has proposed a March 1 ceasefire in Syria, U.S. officials say, but Washington believes Moscow is giving itself and the Syrian government three weeks to try to crush moderate rebel groups. \n \n The United States has countered with demands for the fighting to stop immediately, the officials said Wednesday. Peace talks are supposed to resume by Feb. 25. \n \n The talk of new ceasefire plans comes as the U.S., Russia and more than a dozen other countries meet in Munich to try to halt five years of civil war in the Arab country. The conflict has killed more than a quarter-million people, created Europe's biggest refugee crisis since World War II and allowed the Islamic State to carve out its own territory across parts of Syria and neighboring Iraq. \n \n Russia says it is supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad's government as part of a counterterrorism campaign. But the West says the majority of its strikes are targeting moderate groups that are opposed to Assad and the Islamic State. \n \n The most recent Russian-backed offensive, near Aleppo, prompted opposition groups to walk out of peace talks last month in Geneva, while forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee toward the Turkish border. \n \n The U.S. officials weren't authorized to speak publicly about private diplomatic discussions in the run-up to the Munich conference and demanded anonymity. One said the U.S. can't accept Russia's offer because opposition forces could suffer irreversible losses in northern and southern Syria before the ceasefire ever takes hold. \n \n The officials said the U.S. counterproposal is simple: A ceasefire that is effective immediately and is accompanied by full humanitarian access to Syria's besieged civilian centers. \n \n Secretary of State John Kerry, who arrived in Germany Wednesday, had talks planned late in the evening with U.N. peace envoy Staffan de Mistura and Adel al-Jubeir, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, a key backer of Syria's rebel groups. \n \n The Obama administration has been trying for months to clinch a ceasefire and pave the way for a transition government in Syria that would allow parties to the conflict to concentrate on defeating the threat posed by the Islamic State and the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front. \n \n But after having long demanded Assad's ouster, the shift in the U.S. focus to combating terrorism has resulted in a confusing mix of priorities and a layered strategy in Syria that few understand, and even fewer see working. Beyond Russia, the administration has often struggled to keep its own allies such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia in line. \n \n \"We will approach this meeting in Munich with great hopes that this will be a telling moment,\" Kerry said Tuesday in Washington. His peace push coincides with Defense Secretary Ash Carter's attendance at a gathering in Brussels to hash out military options with NATO partners. \n \n Brett McGurk, the Obama administration's point-man for defeating the Islamic State, said Russia's Aleppo offensive was having the perverse effect of helping the extremists by drawing local fighters away from the battle against IS and to the war against Syria's government. \n \n \"What Russia's doing is directly enabling ISIL,\" McGurk told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in Washington. \n \n But the panel's top Democrat echoed some of the frustration of his Republican colleagues with the larger U.S. strategy. \n \n \"It seems as if we're only halfheartedly going after ISIS, and halfheartedly helping the (rebel) Free Syria Army and others on the ground,\" said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. He urged a \"robust campaign, not a tentative one, not one that seems like we're dragging ourselves in ... to destroy ISIS and get rid of Assad.\" \n \n Kerry emphasized Tuesday that U.S. officials \"are not blind to what is happening.\" He said the Aleppo battle makes it \"much more difficult to be able to come to the table and to be able to have a serious conversation.\" \n \n But the U.S. has staked its hopes for an end to the five-year civil war in Syria on the peace talks and Assad's eventual departure, saying the American public has no appetite for a military solution. \n \n To that end, Washington has tempered its calls dating back to August 2011 for Assad to immediately leave power. And to get Russia on board, it now won't even say that Assad should be barred from running for re-election if and when a new Syrian constitution is drafted. \n \n The ambiguity has emboldened Assad's supporters, Russia and Iran, while upsetting American allies in the Middle East, who are frustrated by a process that appears to lock the Syrian leader in place well into 2017 \u2014 and perhaps beyond.",
        "Summary": "The Syrian Centre for Policy Research (SCPR) reports that the nearly five-year conflict in Syria has caused 470,000 deaths, significantly higher than the United Nations' previous estimate of 250,000. The SCPR estimates that 11.5% of the population has been killed or injured, with 1.9 million wounded. Life expectancy has dropped from 70 in 2010 to 55.4 in 2015, and economic losses are estimated at $255 billion. The conflict has displaced 45% of the population, with 6.36 million internally displaced and over 4 million fleeing abroad. Aleppo is in danger of being cut off by a government advance supported by Russian airstrikes and Iranian militiamen. The International Red Cross reports that 50,000 people have fled fighting in the north, requiring urgent food and water deliveries. Talks between US Secretary of State John Kerry and Russian counterpart Sergei Lavrov are scheduled, with the US demanding an immediate ceasefire, while Russia proposes a March 1 ceasefire. The US believes Russia is trying to crush moderate rebel groups. The Syrian economy has suffered greatly, with a 53% rise in consumer prices and 13.8 million people losing their livelihoods. The conflict has destroyed Syria's social and economic fabric, with international interventions deepening polarization among Syrians.",

West Virginia law does not require inspections for chemical storage facilities \u2014 only for production facilities. \n \n Some other states do require inspections of chemical storage facilities. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said he was working with Randy Huffman, the secretary of the State Department of Environmental Protection, to come up with recommendations aimed at avoiding future leaks. \n \n The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported Sunday that a team of experts from the United States Chemical Safety Board asked the state three years ago to create a new program to prevent accidents and releases in the Kanawha Valley, known as Chemical Valley. \n \n That came after investigation of the August 2008 explosion and fire that killed two workers at the Bayer CropScience plant in Institute, W.Va. No program was produced, and another team from the same board is expected to arrive Monday to investigate this accident. \n \n Critics say the problems are widespread in a state where the coal and chemical industries, which drive much of West Virginia\u2019s economy and are powerful forces in the state\u2019s politics, have long pushed back against tight federal health, safety and environmental controls. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cWest Virginia has a pattern of resisting federal oversight and what they consider E.P.A. interference, and that really puts workers and the population at risk,\u201d said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a lecturer in environmental health at George Washington University. \n \n But Mr. Huffman disputed that accusation, noting that West Virginia\u2019s economy is more heavily dependent than other states on the coal and chemical industries. \u201cBased upon the types of industrial activity, how does it compare to the rest of the country? It\u2019s not in context.\u201d Although he added, \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse for any incident where someone gets hurt.\u201d \n \n Efforts to clean up the spill showed signs of improvement on Sunday. \n \n \u201cThe numbers look good, and like last night, they are very encouraging,\u201d Governor Tomblin said in a news conference on Sunday. \u201cI believe we\u2019re at a point where we can say we\u2019re seeing light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d \n \n Officials said tests conducted at a water treatment plant downstream from the site of the leak showed little to no traces of contamination on Sunday morning, allowing testing to move to the next phase. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Once the testing is complete, the water company plans to begin lifting the do-not-use ban by zones. The work will start in downtown Charleston and three other \u201cpriority zones\u201d that include the city\u2019s four major hospitals and 25,000 customers who use more than half of the company\u2019s water, said Jeff McIntyre, the president of West Virginia American Water. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re several days from starting the lift, but I\u2019m saying not today,\u201d Mr. McIntyre said. \n \n Government offices and many businesses planned to reopen on Monday, while many schools in the affected areas would remain closed, officials said. \n \n \u201cStores are open,\u201d said Jimmy Gianato, the state director of homeland security. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get back to normal.\u201d \n \n Emergency rooms have treated about 169 patients for symptoms related to chemical exposure, said Karen Bowling, the state health secretary. Ten people were admitted to three hospitals with symptoms that were not life threatening, she said. \n \n The chemical in last Thursday\u2019s spill was 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM. The leak at the Elk River storage facility came from a ruptured tank storing this chemical, which is used to wash coal. \n \n No charges have been filed against Freedom Industries, the company that owns the plant, but the United States attorney\u2019s office has already begun an investigation into the spill. \n \n \u201cWhenever you have a discharge of a pollutant or a hazardous substance you have potential violation of the environmental laws,\u201d said Booth Goodwin, the United States attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, according to a news report on WVVA.com. \n \n This is not the first chemical accident to hit West Virginia\u2019s Kanawha Valley. \n \n After an explosion at a West Virginia chemical plant owned by Bayer CropScience killed two employees in 2008, a 2010 congressional investigation found that managers refused for several hours to tell emergency responders the nature of the blast or the toxic chemical it released. It also found that they later misused a law intended to keep information from terrorists to try to stop federal investigators from learning what had happened. The plant manufactured the same chemical that was being processed at the time of a gas release in 1984 that killed 10,000 in Bhopal, India. \n \n West Virginia is also no stranger to accidents in the coal industry. \n \n In 2012, federal prosecutors charged David C. Hughart, a top executive at Massey Energy, a West Virginia coal operator, with a felony count and a second misdemeanor conspiracy count related to the deaths of 29 coal miners in a 2009 explosion at West Virginia\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine. Prosecutors said that Mr. Hughart and others knowingly conspired to violate safety laws at Massey\u2019s mines and worked to hide those violations by giving advance warnings of surprise inspections by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. \n \n In 2009, an investigation by The New York Times found that hundreds of workplaces in West Virginia had violated pollution laws without paying fines. In interviews at the time, current and former West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection employees said their enforcement efforts had been undermined by bureaucratic disorganization; a departmental preference to let polluters escape punishment if they promised to try harder; and a revolving door of regulators who left for higher-paying jobs at the companies they once policed. \n \n In June 2009, four environmental groups petitioned the E.P.A. to take over much of West Virginia\u2019s handling of the Clean Water Act, citing a \u201cnearly complete breakdown\u201d in the state. \n \n \u201cHistorically, there had been a questionable enforcement ethic,\u201d said Matthew Crum, a former state mining director at the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection. \n \n Cindy Rank, chairwoman of the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy\u2019s mining committee, said that the coal lobby has wielded great influence in crafting state environmental regulations. \u201cAccidents are always preventable. For the most part I think that\u2019s true in these disasters that keep happening,\u201d she said. She recalled negotiations over a groundwater protection bill from the early 1990s. \u201cWe swallowed hard and allowed the coal industry to get away with a lot in that bill,\u201d she said. ||||| Hundreds of thousands of West Virginia residents have gone more than four days without clean tap water after a chemical spill, though officials say that chemical readouts are returning to safe levels. NBC's Anne Thompson reports. \n \n The latest tests of poisoned water in West Virginia have shown that the quality is improving \u201cin the right direction,\u201d the state\u2019s governor said Sunday \u2014 a hopeful sign for the 300,000 residents currently under a strict tap water ban following a chemical spill four days ago. \n \n \"We are at a point where we can see a light at the end of the tunnel,\" Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said at a news conference. \n \n But officials stopped short of saying when the do-not-use order would be lifted. \n \n \"I can tell you we\u2019re not several days from starting to lift, but I\u2019m not saying today,\" said Jeff McIntyre, president of West Virginia American Water, which runs the water treatment plant. \n \n The chemical spill first noticed Thursday on the Elk River has contaminated the water supply in the heart of the state, shutting down schools and businesses across nine counties, and forcing emergency agencies to truck in clean water to the Charleston region. \n \n Lt. Col. Greg Grant of the West Virginia National Guard said two tests Sunday morning at the treatment facility show the chemical\u2019s concentration at 0 parts-per-million for water going in and out of the plant. \n \n Before the all clear can be given once and for all, water sample test results must consistently show that the chemical\u2019s presence in the public water system is at or below 1 parts-per-million, the level recommended by federal agencies. \n \n \"That is a very encouraging and allows us to move forward\" with the next phase of sampling and testing, Grant said. \n \n Sixteen teams were collecting samples from affected areas in the region, and officials cautioned that the ban won\u2019t be lifted until results were in and the state health department signs off. Communities will be given the OK on a zone-by-zone basis. \n \n Marcus Constantino / The Daily Mail via AP Members of the West Virginia Army National Guard, along with a member of the Belle Police Department and a volunteer, offload emergency water from a military truck to a forklift as citizens line up Saturday for water at the Belle Fire Department in Belle, W.Va. \n \n West Virginia American Water is launching an online map to show which communities can begin using their tap water. The company will also autodial customers when the ban in their zone has been lifted. A hotline is also being made available to them. \n \n Schools will also be closed or partially closed in six counties Monday, although officials expect most students to be back in classrooms by Tuesday. \n \n The reliance on bottled water is taking its toll on frustrated residents who\u2019ve stripped stores and spent hours in long lines to collect water from tankers set up by the National Guard. Until the water is deemed safe, residents have been asked not to drink, bathe and cook with the tainted tap. \n \n The environmental emergency began Thursday morning, when the state Department of Environmental Protection began receiving complaints around 8:15 a.m. of a licorice-type odor in the tap water. It took three hours before officials found the source of the spill. \n \n The source turned out to be the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, which had leaked out of a 40,000-gallon tank at a Freedom Industries facility along the Elk River. \n \n Freedom Industries didn\u2019t report the leak to a spill hotline until 12:05 p.m. ET Thursday. \n \n State officials said Saturday they believe about 7,500 gallons leaked. Some of the chemical was contained before flowing into the river; it\u2019s not clear exactly how much entered the water supply. \n \n All told, 169 people have sought treatment at hospitals for symptoms such as nausea. Of those, 10 were admitted to three different hospitals, but their conditions weren\u2019t serious. \n \n Federal authorities, including the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, have opened an investigation into Thursday\u2019s spill. \n \n According to the state DEP, Freedom Industries is exempt from DEP inspections and permitting since it stores chemicals, and doesn\u2019t produce them. \n \n But the DEP ordered Freedom Industries to move its coal processing chemicals to a safer site and said it has 24 hours to start writing a plan on how it will clean up the spill and any soil contamination. \n \n The company did not take part in Sunday\u2019s news conference, and Gov. Tomblin said the state hasn\u2019t had much guidance from the company about the chemical in question. \n \n \"Perhaps they could have been a little bit more forthcoming to offer their assistance about what problems this particular chemical could cause,\" Tomblin said. \n \n Tomblin said he will work with his environmental agency chief on tightening regulation of chemical storage facilities in the current legislative session. \n \n Most visitors have cleared out of Charleston while locals are either staying home or driving out of the area to find a hot meal or a shower elsewhere. Orders not to use tap water for much other than flushing toilets mean that the spill is an emergency not just for the environment but for local businesses. \n \n Lisa Hechesky / Reuters Boats sit in the Elk River in front of the Freedom Industries plant in Charleston, W. Va., on Saturday. \n \n In downtown Charleston, the store Taylor Books usually fills the 40 seats in its cafe. But the cafe was shut down by the state Department of Health on Friday because it said employees had no way to safely wash their hands before serving customers. On Saturday only three people sat in the bookstore using the wireless Internet. \n \n Taylor Books' manager Dan Carlisle said he canceled a musician scheduled to play that night and the store was going to close five hours early. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s pretty annoying,\u201d Carlisle said about Freedom Industries\u2019 response to the spill. \u201cI feel like you should just be honest with people immediately.\u201d \n \n In a statement issued Friday, Freedom Industries said that it was working with government agencies to contain the leak, and \u201cthe first priority was safety, containment and cleanup.\u201d \n \n The chemical spill has forced West Virginia's residents to examine the state's reliance on the coal and chemical industries. \n \n Coal is critical to the economy. Strong coal prices and demand proved vital to the state budget during and after the national recession, from 2009 through 2011. \n \n In Gov. Tomblin's recent State-of-the-State speech, he touted the chemical industry, saying it was among those that grew substantially over the last year. \n \n The spill that tainted the water supply involved a chemical used in coal processing. But it didn't involve a coal mine \u2014 and that's a point state officials are trying to convey to the public. \n \n When asked if the emergency is one of the risks of being a state that relies heavily on the coal industry, Tomblin quickly responded: \"This was not a coal company incident, this was a chemical company incident.\" \n \n \"It's used in processing coal, as I understand it, but obviously it was not a coal company, it was a chemical company that left the breach and the tanks that's holding this particular chemical,\" he said. \n \n The coal industry, too, was saying they should not bear the blame in this case. \n \n \"This is a chemical spill accident. It just so happens that the chemical has some applications to the coal industry, just that fact alone shouldn't cause people to point fingers at the coal industry,\" said Jason Bostic, vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "Document": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the United States military prepares to leave Iraq by the end of 2011, the Obama administration is planning a remarkable civilian effort, buttressed by a small army of contractors, to fill the void. \n \n By October 2011, the State Department will assume responsibility for training the Iraqi police, a task that will largely be carried out by contractors. With no American soldiers to defuse sectarian tensions in northern Iraq, it will be up to American diplomats in two new $100 million outposts to head off potential confrontations between the Iraqi Army and Kurdish pesh merga forces. \n \n To protect the civilians in a country that is still home to insurgents with Al Qaeda and Iranian-backed militias, the State Department is planning to more than double its private security guards, up to as many as 7,000, according to administration officials who disclosed new details of the plan. Defending five fortified compounds across the country, the security contractors would operate radars to warn of enemy rocket attacks, search for roadside bombs, fly reconnaissance drones and even staff quick reaction forces to aid civilians in distress, the officials said. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think State has ever operated on its own, independent of the U.S. military, in an environment that is quite as threatening on such a large scale,\u201d said James Dobbins, a former ambassador who has seen his share of trouble spots as a special envoy for Afghanistan, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo and Somalia. \u201cIt is unprecedented in scale.\u201d \n \n White House officials expressed confidence that the transfer to civilians \u2014 about 2,400 people who would work at the Baghdad embassy and other diplomatic sites \u2014 would be carried out on schedule, and that they could fulfill their mission of helping bring stability to Iraq. \n \n \u201cThe really big picture that we have seen in Iraq over the last year and a half to two years is this: the number of violent incidents is significantly down, the competence of Iraqi security forces is significantly up, and politics has emerged as the basic way of doing business in Iraq,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, the national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cIf that trend continues, and I acknowledge it is an \u2018if,\u2019 that creates a much better context for dealing with the very significant and serious problems that remain in Iraq.\u201d \n \n But the tiny military presence under the Obama administration\u2019s plan \u2014 limited to several dozen to several hundred officers in an embassy office who would help the Iraqis purchase and field new American military equipment \u2014 and the civilians\u2019 growing portfolio have led some veteran Iraq hands to suggest that thousands of additional troops will be needed after 2011. \n \n \u201cWe need strategic patience here,\u201d Ryan C. Crocker, who served as ambassador in Iraq from 2007 until early 2009, said in an interview. \u201cOur timetables are getting out ahead of Iraqi reality. We do have an Iraqi partner in this. We certainly are not the ones making unilateral decisions anymore. But if they come to us later on this year requesting that we jointly relook at the post-2011 period, it is going to be in our strategic interest to be responsive.\u201d \n \n The array of tasks for which American troops are likely to be needed, military experts and some Iraqi officials say, include training Iraqi forces to operate and logistically support new M-1 tanks, artillery and F-16s they intend to acquire from the Americans; protecting Iraq\u2019s airspace until the country can rebuild its air force; and perhaps assisting Iraq\u2019s special operations units in carrying out counterterrorism operations. \n \n Such an arrangement would need to be negotiated with Iraqi officials, who insisted on the 2011 deadline in the agreement with the Bush administration for removing American forces. With the Obama administration in campaign mode for the coming midterm elections and Iraqi politicians yet to form a government, the question of what future military presence might be needed has been all but banished from public discussion. \n \n \u201cThe administration does not want to touch this question right now,\u201d said one administration official involved in Iraq issues, adding that military officers had suggested that 5,000 to 10,000 troops might be needed. \u201cIt runs counter to their political argument that we are getting out of these messy places,\u201d the official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, added. \u201cAnd it would be quite counterproductive to talk this way in front of the Iraqis. If the Iraqis want us, they should be the demandeur.\u201d ||||| U.S. military officials are hustling to reduce the number of troops in Iraq to 50,000 to meet President Obama's Aug. 31 deadline for an end to U.S. combat operations, but as troops leave, the administration reportedly is planning to double the number of private security guards in the country. \n \n A senior military official in Iraq said the Defense Department will meet the deadline for exiting combat troops. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT \n \n \"We are sitting around 55k and will be down to 50k by 1 September,\" the official wrote in an e-mail to Fox News. \n \n The bulk of the 4th Stryker Brigade from the 2nd Infantry Division left the country on Thursday. Approximately 100 members of the brigade remain in Iraq to handle various administrative and supply issues. They will be out of the country within days. \n \n After Aug. 31, the mission in Iraq will no longer be known as Operation Iraqi Freedom and will instead be known as Operation New Dawn. \n \n Obama, who had imposed an end-of-the-month deadline for the pullout in February 2009, called it a milestone in the war though the remaining 50,000 support troops will stay in Iraq until the end of next year to train Iraqi forces. \n \n The U.S. still has \"a significant amount of influence\" in Iraq, and the mission will be to provide support and help the country grow and \"give economic development\" assistance, said Maj. Gen. Stephen Lanza, a spokesman for Gen. Ray Odierno, the top U.S. commander in Iraq. \n \n When the last of the military troops leave at the end of 2011, the Obama administration is planning to more than double the number of private security guards it has in Iraq -- up to 7,000 -- The New York Times reported late Wednesday, citing unnamed administration officials. \n \n The U.S. State Department move is aimed at protecting civilians still exposed to Al Qaeda-linked insurgents and Iranian-backed militias. At the same time, Afghanistan is asking the United States to remove a bulk of its 45,000 private contractors from the country. \n \n Contractors employed by the State Department will train the Iraqi police and U.S. diplomats in two new $100 million outposts will be left to defuse sectarian tensions in northern Iraq. \n \n The security contractors, defending five fortified compounds around the country, will operate radars to warn of enemy rocket attacks, search for roadside bombs, fly reconnaissance drones and staff quick reaction forces to help civilians in distress, the officials told the Times. \n \n As the exit of the troops was shown live on TV in the U.S. Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley described the end of combat operations as a \"historic moment,\" but vowed that America's long-term commitment was unwavering. \n \n \"The last thing that we want to see is an occasion where we have to send troops back into Iraq yet again so we are ending the combat phase of our involvement in Iraq for a second time,\" he said. \n \n \"We're not ending our involvement in Iraq. We will have important work to do. This is a transition. This is not the end of something. It's a transition to something different. We have a long-term commitment to Iraq.\" \n \n Crowley said that after spending $1 trillion in Iraq and with 4,400 lives lost, the conflict had come \"at high expense.\" \n \n \"We've invested heavily in Iraq and have to do everything we can to preserve that investment to integrate Iraq, along with the neighborhood, into a much more peaceful situation that serves their interests as well as ours. But this is a historic moment.\" \n \n Obama said the events were the beginning of the pullout he promised when he became president. \n \n \"As we mark this milestone in the Iraq war and our troops continue to move out of Iraq, I hope you'll join me in thanking them, and all of our troops and military families, for their service,\" Obama said. \n \n \"My administration will continue to do our part to support the brave men and women in uniform that have sacrificed so much. But supporting our troops and their families is not just the job of the federal government; it's the responsibility of all Americans. \n \n \"Shortly after taking office, I put forward a plan to end the war in Iraq responsibly. Today, I'm pleased to report that -- thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians in Iraq -- our combat mission will end this month, and we will complete a substantial drawdown of our troops. \n \n \"Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all of our troops will be out of Iraq by the end of next year. Meanwhile, we will continue to build a strong partnership with the Iraqi people with an increased civilian commitment and diplomatic effort.\" \n \n NewsCore contributed to this report.",

Despite the reduction of troops to 50,000 by the end of August 2011, some experts suggest that additional troops may be needed post-2011 to assist with various military tasks.

        "Document": "Alan Miller McCarty watched most of his trial Thursday morning from behind one-way glass in a small room after yelling at, interrupting and crudely insulting the presiding judge. \n \n DAYTONA BEACH \u2014 Alan Miller McCarty watched most of his trial Thursday morning from behind one-way glass in a small room after yelling at, interrupting and crudely insulting the presiding judge. \n \n By mid afternoon McCarty was found guilty on all charges related to his threats to kill another judge who ruled in an earlier custody case involving McCarty. \n \n The jury of three women and three men took about 30 minutes to find McCarty guilty of two counts of threats or extortion and two counts of corruption by threat against a public official. Besides threatening the judge, McCarty also threatened a pair of dispatchers in the phone calls. \n \n When the guilty verdicts were read, McCarty was unusually quiet as he sat flanked by deputies. McCarty faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced by Circuit Judge Matt Foxman. Foxman\u2019s next sentencing date is set for Oct. 12. \n \n McCarty, 36, also faces more charges since he is also accused of calling Stewart-Marchman-Act Behavioral Healthcare and threatening staffers there. \n \n The move earlier in the day to the adjacent room didn\u2019t help much as McCarty continued to shout expletives, curse the presiding judge, the witnesses and the entire judicial system. \n \n Everyone in the courtroom \u2014 Judge Foxman, attorneys and the jurors \u2014 could hear McCarty\u2019s screams, which included offensive expletives. He railed that he was not allowed to present evidence. He screamed that his \u201cpapers\u201d had been taken away. He yelled that his attorney was not asking enough questions. And he hollered that his children had been unfairly taken away from him. \n \n McCarty, who was on suicide watch at the Volusia County Branch Jail, refused to dress as defendants typically do for their trials, in shirt, tie and dress pants. Instead, McCarty remained in his jail-issued orange jumpsuit. Also unlike a typical trial, McCarty wore a pair of handcuffs in view of the jury. \n \n McCarty\u2019s morning outbursts included his derisive invitation to the judge to perform oral sex on him. Foxman politely declined by saying, \u201cI prefer not to.\u201d \n \n After McCarty kept screaming, Foxman ordered him into the small room with the one-way glass. McCarty remained there through most of the trial in handcuffs and accompanied by a pair of deputies. \n \n The judge told the jurors that McCarty had chosen to be in the room to which McCarty could be heard screaming that he did not and that his rights had been taken away. \n \n \u201cNo I have not!\u201d McCarty screamed from behind the mirrored glass. \n \n The jurors did not appear to be fazed by McCarty\u2019s screaming. They didn\u2019t even appear to look back to the mirror-like glass where the shouting was coming from. \n \n McCarty, of Milton in Santa Rosa County, was arrested on Sept. 30. He made phone threats toward Circuit Judge Stasia Warren, who ruled in his earlier custody case. \n \n McCarty was flanked by several deputies when the judge permitted him to return to his seat in the courtroom near Assistant Public Defender Ryan Belanger. He told jurors that he was upset that Warren was allowing that his ex-wife get his kids. \n \n That\u2019s why he said he had made the calls in which he threatened to kill Warren. \n \n One juror seemed to have a pained expression on her face during McCarty\u2019s testimony. \n \n Throughout the trial the judge, the jurors, attorneys and deputies were patient and professional in the face of McCarty\u2019s insults or outbursts. \n \n In a press release after the verdict, State Attorney R.J. Larizza said that McCarty\u2019s \u201cvulgar and threatening racist rants were as chilling and offensive as any I have ever heard. Threatening Judges is an attack on the very heart of our Criminal Justice System.\u201d \n \n Belanger said during his closing argument that the squeaky wheel gets the grease and McCarty was a very squeaky wheel. He said McCarty felt he had no other choice since he was losing his children when he made the threats in the calls. \n \n Assistant State Attorney Ashley Terwilleger, who prosecuted the case along with MaryCatherine Crock, said that McCarty\u2019s words mattered and that Warren was fearful that McCarty would make good on his threats. She also said McCarty\u2019s children had been in Texas since about 2007 and he had not seen them for two years before his arrest last year. \n \n As he was questioned by Belanger, McCarty said his statements on the phone calls were just words. McCarty said he didn\u2019t mean it, just like Foxman didn\u2019t mean it, McCarty said, when the judge on Monday threatened to have the defendant\u2019s mouth taped shut if he didn\u2019t behave during the trial. \n \n Foxman did not follow through on the duct tape but the courtroom was staffed with extra deputies. And while McCarty did not have any adhesive tape around his mouth he did wear an electric belt under his jumpsuit that would allow a deputy to deliver a stunning zap if needed. \n \n McCarty called dispatchers on Sept. 29 and threatened Warren, who hears juvenile delinquency and dependency cases. \n \n \u201cWhere\u2019s your Judge Warren at?\u201d McCarty is recorded telling dispatchers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to bring that (expletive deleted) out in handcuffs and I\u2019m going to (expletive deleted) execute that (expletive deleted) right in the (expletive deleted) street.\u201d \n \n Judge Warren took the stand in the morning and testified that she had been frightened when she was told of the threats McCarty had made against her life. \n \n McCarty was in the small room while Warren testified and would occasionally shout out something. He called Warren \u201can (expletive) liar\u201d at one point during the morning. \n \n Warren started to say something directed at McCarty, but Belanger objected and Foxman sustained it. \n \n As McCarty was about to be escorted out of the courtroom, he said he wanted to press charges against Foxman. McCarty said Foxman had threatened him with taping his mouth shut. \n \n The judge told him one of the bailiffs would take the report from him as McCarty was led out of the courtroom and back to jail. ||||| DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for threatening to kill a judge he believed ruled against him in his custody case. \n \n The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports 36-year-old Alan McCarty Jr. spent much of the hearing in an adjacent room with a speaker and one-way glass, just like he did during his trial, after unleashing a fresh stream of obscenities Wednesday at the judge, the prosecutor and even his own public defender. \n \n McCarty was convicted last month of threatening to kill Circuit Judge Stasia Warren last year when he mistakenly blamed her for taking his kids away in a custody case. \n \n A prosecutor's statement says the 20-year sentence will give McCarty ample time to reflect on the seriousness of his threats against the judicial system.",

Officers surrounded a silver Hyundai Elantra in the parking lot of an Aspen Hill Kohl's store, and the suspect, 62-year-old Eulalio Tordil was inside. \n \n FOX 5's Alexandra Limon was live on the air when police began rushing across the street from the parking lot of a Giant food store, where one of two shootings took place on Friday morning. Limon's crew was quickly moved away, but moments later, things settled-- and Tordil was in custody. (WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE) \n \n Shortly thereafter, Montgomery County Police confirmed that a suspect was indeed in custody, and it was Tordil. He was arrested in the parking lot of the same shopping center where the D.C. Beltway sniper attacks began. The first shot was fired to the Michaels craft store, which is still there, on October 2, 2002. Investigators said Tordil ate at the same restaurant, a Boston Market, where John Allen Mohammed and Lee Boyd Malvo ate. \n \n Earlier Friday, two people were killed in two separate shootings in Montgomery County. The first happened outside Montgomery Mall, and the second outside the Aspen Hill Giant grocery store. \n \n MONTGOMERY MALL SHOOTING \n \n On Friday morning at around 11:13 am, an off-duty officer called dispatch and other officers that shots were fired during a confrontation outside of Westfield Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, and two men and a woman were wounded. One of the men died, and the second man is in critical condition at Suburban Hospital. The female victim is also at the hospital in stable condition with non-life threatening injuries. \n \n Police said they believed two of the people who were shot at that scene were hit when they came to the aid of the first victim. \n \n Westfield Montgomery released the following statement regarding the shootings after Tordil was arrested: \n \n \"There was a shooting this morning in the parking lot of Westfield Montgomery and the suspect immediately fled the scene. We worked closely with Montgomery County PD on site and the center remained open serving as shelter for those who wished to remain inside. We are grateful to local law enforcement for their efforts to secure the site and insure the safety of the community. \n \n All of us in this community are shocked and saddened by these events. We send our heartfelt condolences to the victims of this tragedy and their families. \n \n We encourage you to follow official updates on Montgomery County Police Department.\" \n \n ASPEN HILL SHOOTING \n \n At around 11:50 p.m., a second shooting was reported outside a Giant grocery store in Aspen Hill located on Connecticut Avenue. Montgomery County police confirmed that one woman was shot in her car, and she was pronounced dead at the scene. \n \n SUSPECT ARRESTED \n \n Before Tordil's arrest, Montgomery County police confirmed they were looking into the possibility that Friday's shootings were connected to another deadly shooting that took place on Thursday afternoon outside a High Point High School in Beltsville, Md. Detectives say Tordil shot and killed his estranged wife outside the school in what investigators called a domestic-related shooting. Another man was also shot as he tried to intervene and help the victim. \n \n On Thursday night, police issued an alert for Tordil, who was said to be driving a silver 2015 Hyundai Elantra with Pennsylvania license plate JZA0123. Tordil is an employee of the Federal Protection Service, and police warned that he may have been wearing body armor and may be heavily armed. \n \n Also before the arrest, sources told FOX 5's Marina Marraco that Friday's shootings were connected to Thursday night's shooting, but Montgomery County Police Captain Paul Starks said he could not confirm a connection, and they were continuing to look into the possibility of a connection. \n \n In a press conference late Friday afternoon with officials from both counties, authorities said Tordil was the alleged gunman in all three shootings. Police said officers responding to the Giant parking lot shooting located the vehicle that matched the description parked in the Northgate Shopping Center. \n \n Montgomery County Police Chief Tom Manger said plainclothes officers had Tordil under surveillance in the area and they were extremely careful to make sure they kept the public safe. Authorities said he had earlier threatened to \"commit suicide by cop.\" \n \n \"We had him under surveillance and he was walking from store to store and at no point was it safe to take him into custody until we did,\" said Manger. \n \n After he came out of the Dunkin' Donuts, police cornered Tordil at his car. \n \n \"They came in from all directions,\" said one witness. \"They boxed him in, they rammed the car from the front and the back, pulled guns on him and told him to get out of the vehicle.\" \n \n Without a single gunshot from both police and the suspect, Tordil exited his car and surrendered peacefully. \n \n CHARGES \n \n On Friday night, Prince George's County police officially charged Tordil with first-degree murder and related charges for the fatal shooting of his wife. He was also charged with assault for shooting a bystander who attempted to intervene in the confrontation between the couple. \n \n Charges are pending against Tordil in connection to the shootings in Montgomery County. He was in custody Friday night at Montgomery County police headquarters being interviewed. He will be arraigned in District Court Monday afternoon. \n \n SCHOOLS ON ALERT \n \n A shelter-in-place order was issued for all Montgomery County schools out of what Starks called an abundance of caution, but just before 2:30 pm, that order was lifted at all but five schools. Following Tordil's arrest, all shelter-in-place orders were lifted. \n \n Stay with FOX 5 and fox5dc.com for updates. ||||| A suspected gunman is in custody after two people were killed in separate shootings at a mall and grocery store in Montgomery County, Maryland, today, and police say the shootings may be linked to a deadly domestic shooting in the area yesterday. \n \n The suspect, Eulalio Tordil, 62, was taken into custody today in the Aspen Hill, Maryland, area, police said.

One person was shot and two others may have been shot coming to that person's aid, he said. There's no reason to believe the victims knew the shooter, he said. \n \n About a half an hour later, police were called to a shooting at a Giant Food store in Aspen Hill, about 5 miles away. Police later tweeted that a woman died after that shooting. It's not clear if the shootings are connected. \n \n No one is in custody, McSwain said, but police are looking at a person of interest. \n \n The upscale mall is located in Bethesda, about 10 miles northwest of downtown Washington. \n \n Police in neighboring Prince George's County are looking into the possibility that the shootings could be connect to a fatal shooting at a high school on Wednesday, spokeswoman Julie Parker said.

Schools were given a \"shelter-in-place\" order around 1 p.m., schools spokeswoman Gboyinde Onijala said.

Other than his wife, none of the victims has yet been publicly identified. In a statement late Friday, Montgomery police said Tordil was \u201ccurrently being interviewed by detectives,\u201d and they indicated that he had not been charged in that jurisdiction. \u00ad \n \n The killing began Thursday afternoon, investigators say, when Tordil approached his estranged wife, Gladys Tordil, as she waited in a parking lot at High Point High School in Beltsville to pick up her two daughters. \n \n When a man tried to intervene, authorities said, Tordil shot him in the shoulder. They say Tordil then pointed his weapon at his wife\u2019s SUV, firing repeatedly until she died. \n \n At that moment, her 16-year-old daughter was walking out of a nearby band room. Hearing the shots, another student pulled her back inside and ran to alert others. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s when the whole school panicked,\u201d said 17-year-old Chris Mejia, High Point\u2019s senior class president. \n \n \n \n \n \n In March, at the behest of his wife, a civil court issued a protective order against Tordil for alleged abuse, according to court documents. In the filing, she claimed that her husband, a black belt in the martial-art form of aikido, subjected her children to \u201cintense-military-like discipline\u201d and that he struck her in 2010. \n \n \u201cHe threatened to harm me,\u201d she said, \u201cif I leave him.\u201d \n \n As a result of the order, his employer, the Federal Protective Service, put him on administrative duties and stripped him of his gun and badge. Authorities say they also confiscated a stockpile of his personal weapons. His wife indicated in the protective order that he owned .40-caliber and .45-caliber handguns, an M4 military carbine, a revolver and a \u201chunting gun.\u201d \n \n Under \u201cfavorite quotes\u201d on Tordil\u2019s Facebook page, it lists a single misspelled line: \u201cYou can ran, but you can\u2019t hide.\u201d \n \n Authorities tried to begin tracking Tordil immediately after the shooting at High Point. \n \n They had little to work with and were contending with a suspect whose career in law enforcement made him even harder to pursue, said Prince George\u2019s County Police Chief Henry P. Stawinski III. \n \n Tordil had turned off his phone 20 minutes before the first shooting and never turned it back on. Video of the shooting was grainy and showed only a silver sedan, but police quickly learned that he had leased the Elantra and knew the Pennsylvania license plate number. \n \n That provided them the only firm nugget of information to track their suspect. \n \n Police didn\u2019t release details about the car to the public Thursday night, fearing Tordil might catch on and abandon it, Stawin\u00adski said. But they did inform other law enforcement officers. \n \n \u201cHe is a police officer, and he would be doing countersurveillance on us and watching the media,\u201d the chief said. \u201cIf he knew we knew that was his car, he would get rid of the car.\u201d \n \n More than 100 undercover officers, homicide detectives and special patrol teams from Prince George\u2019s alone fanned throughout the region. The car\u2019s license tag was spotted around midnight, but Tordil eluded authorities throughout the night. \n \n The violence on Friday began about 11:15 a.m., police said, when Tordil fatally shot one man and wounded another man and a woman in the parking lot of Westfield Montgomery Mall. Police said they think that Tordil shot two of the three as they rushed to help the first victim. As of late Friday night, they said the wounded man was in critical condition and the woman in stable condition with non-life-threatining injuries. \n \n Jose Mauricio Gomez, 54, was eating lunch in his pickup when he heard six to eight shots. When a police officer pulled up next to him, Gomez realized that the crime scene was nearby. \n \n Neither man spotted the shooter, but they did see one victim, a woman with a shoulder wound. \n \n The officer asked the woman, who appeared to be in her 30s, whether she could stand. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s when blood shot out of the hole in her shoulder and he sat her back down,\u201d Gomez said. \n \n The only thing she talked about, he recalled, was how upset her husband was going to be. \n \n While at that scene, officers received a 911 call from the Giant grocery store in Aspen Hill, nine miles away, where a woman had been shot to death in her car. \n \n Soon after, a plainclothes officer spotted Tordil\u2019s car parked across the street from the grocery store, according to McCarthy. Investigators soon realized Tordil was still nearby after showing wanted fliers at area businesses. \n \n Tordil, McCarthy said, first got a cup of coffee at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, then went to Michaels craft store to \u201cbrowse around\u201d before heading to Boston Market, where he quietly ate lunch near a window. \n \n As many as 100 officers kept up surveillance but resisted closing in to avoid a bloody firefight in a bustling shopping area. \n \n \u201cWe needed to make sure the public was safe when we took him into custody,\u201d said Montgomery County Police Chief J. Thomas Manger. \u201cOur fear was he was armed, since he already shot four people today.\u201d \n \n When Tordil returned to his car, officers swarmed. \n \n He was soon led away in handcuffs, with either rain or sweat soaked through his jeans and light-brown polo. \n \n \u201cThe judgments made today by police saved a lot of lives,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThis went down exactly as planned.\u201d \n \n Authorities have no evidence that Tordil knew the people he has been accused of attacking on Friday, leaving investigators to sort through his motivation. \n \n It also remains unclear what led him to allegedly kill his wife, a mother of two teen girls who supported her children and family members in the Philippines. \n \n Gladys Tordil, who taught chemistry at Parkdale High, should have been honored this week \u2014 both for National Teacher Appreciation Week and Mother\u2019s Day \u2014 and not killed in front of her daughter, said Mejia, the student body president. \n \n \u201cMy niece had her as a teacher last year. She said she was a great person,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was always happy, always singing, always dancing.\u201d \n \n On the door of her classroom, more than 100 hand-scrawled sticky notes captured what she had meant to those left behind, a mosaic of memories on squares of pink, blue, green and yellow. \n \n Read one: \u201cTo the reason I\u2019m pursuing Chemistry.\u201d Another: \u201cThank you Mrs. Tordil!

Thomas Manger said. \n \n Police waited about an hour to make the arrest, fearing Tordil was armed, and closed in when he got into his vehicle, Manger said. A weapon was found in the vehicle, he said. \n \n Tordil is an employee of the Federal Protective Service , which protects federal facilities and is part of Homeland Security. \n \n He was placed on administrative duties in March after a protective order was issued against him, the FPS said. \n \n Estranged wife obtained protective order \n \n In March 2016, a Prince George's County district judge ordered that Tordil have no contact with his estranged wife, Gladys Tordil, and two minors thought to be their children. \n \n According to the court documents, Tordil had access to at least three revolvers, which the court ordered him to carry only during work. He had to leave them at his workplace. The FPS said it went one step further after the protective order, removing Tordil's duty weapon, badge and credentials. \n \n Gladys Tordil alleged that Eulalio \"has been subjecting them to intense military-like discipline -- push ups, detention in dark closet,\" according to the order. She said, \"He threatened to harm me if I leave him,\" the documents say. \n \n Prince George's County police charged Eulalio Tordil on Friday with first-degree murder in the shooting of his wife, the department said in a news release posted on its website. He was charged with assault for allegedly shooting a man who tried to intervene. \n \n Montgomery County police have not announced any charges. \n \n Shootings UPDATE: Suspect IN CUSTODY in Aspen Hill area: Eulalio Tordil, 62.

Besides those killed, three people were wounded. Police said they don't know whether Tordil had a relationship with any of the other people who were shot other than Gladys Tordil. \n \n Law enforcement authorities had been looking for Tordil since Thursday, when Gladys Tordil, 44, was killed outside High Point High School in Beltsville in adjacent Prince George's County, police said. The school was one of the places Tordil was ordered to stay away from in the court order. \n \n It appeared Tordil followed her to the school property as she came to pick up her children and confronted her as she sat in her car, police said. \n \n A passerby was shot as he tried to intervene and suffered non-life-threatening injuries, according to a police report. After the wife was shot multiple times, the gunman left the scene, police said. \n \n CNN Map \n \n Around 11 a.m. Friday morning, one man was fatally shot outside Westfield Montgomery mall in Bethesda, according to police. A man and woman were wounded, police said. The man is in critical condition and the woman in stable condition with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. \n \n While officers were investigating that shooting, they received a call at 11:50 a.m. about a shooting in the Giant supermarket parking lot in Aspen Hill, Manger said. Officers found a woman fatally shot inside her vehicle. \n \n Officers searching for the suspect found his vehicle in a nearby shopping center parking lot, then spotted him inside businesses, he said. \n \n Manger said police decided not to confront Tordil right away because they thought he was armed. The suspect spent about an hour in various businesses and ate lunch at a Boston Market, the chief said. \n \n \"He was walking from store to store and at no point was it safe for us to take him into custody until we did,\" Manger said. \"We needed to make sure the public was safe when we took him into custody.\" \n \n When the suspect got in his car, police blocked the vehicle and made the arrest, the official said. \n \n Tordil is expected in court at 1 p.m. Monday in Rockville District Court, police said. \n \n Remembering the D.C. snipers \n \n The area where Tordil was arrested had significance for residents of the District of Columbia. \n \n The D.C.-area snipers , who killed 10 people in 2002, passed through the area, Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy said. \n \n \"They ate in the same restaurant where we were having the surveillance today, which was an irony that was not lost on me,\" he said. \n \n During three weeks in October 2002 , John Allen Muhammad and accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo, then 17, killed 10 people and wounded three, while taunting police with written messages and phoned-in threats and demands. \n \n Muhammed was executed in 2009. Malvo is serving a life sentence. \n \n \"Today's incident was very reminiscent of fear that permeated throughout our communities during the 2002 sniper shootings,\" Prince George's County Executive Rushern L. Baker III said in a statement on the county government website. \"It was also another harsh reality of the terror that gun violence can create.\"",
        "Summary": "Eulalio Tordil, a 62-year-old Federal Protective Service employee, was arrested at an Aspen Hill Kohl's store in connection to two deadly shootings in Montgomery County and the shooting death of his estranged wife, Gladys Tordil, outside High Point High School. Tordil, who had threatened to commit suicide by cop, was under surveillance by plainclothes officers and was apprehended without incident. He has been charged with first-degree murder and assault. The shootings occurred at Westfield Montgomery Mall and Aspen Hill Giant grocery store, prompting a shelter-in-place order for Montgomery County schools, which was later lifted. Tordil's wife had previously obtained a protective order against him, citing abuse. The events have drawn comparisons to the 2002 Beltway sniper attacks, as Tordil was arrested near the same area where those attacks began.",

WSJ's Jason Bellini has #TheShortAnswer. \n \n The U.S. since last year has been secretly flying unmanned surveillance aircraft in small numbers over Iraq to collect intelligence on insurgents, according to U.S. officials. \n \n The program was limited in size and proved little use to U.S. and Iraqi officials when Islamist fighters moved swiftly this week to seize two major Iraqi cities, the officials said. \n \n Before... ||||| Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Paul Wood met refugees who have fled to the Kurdish countryside \n \n US President Barack Obama says his government is looking at \"all options\", including military action, to help Iraq fight Islamist militants. \n \n But the White House also insisted it had no intention of sending ground troops. \n \n The remarks came after the cities of Mosul and Tikrit fell to Sunni Islamist insurgents during a lightning advance. \n \n The US has begun moving defence contractors working with the Iraqi military to safer areas. \n \n \"We can confirm that US citizens, under contract to the government of Iraq, in support of the US Foreign Military Sales (FMS) programme in Iraq, are being temporarily relocated by their companies due to security concerns in the area,\" state department spokesperson Jen Psaki said. \n \n Several hundred were being evacuated from Balad air base to Baghdad, a US defence official told AFP. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Obama: \"The US will do our part, but... it us up to the Iraqis as a sovereign nation to solve their problems.\" \n \n Led by the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS), the insurgents are believed to be planning to push further south to the capital, Baghdad, and regions dominated by Iraq's Shia Muslim majority, whom they regard as \"infidels\". \n \n Unconfirmed reports on Thursday said Iraqi forces had launched air strikes on Mosul and Tikrit targeting the militants. \n \n Correspondents say that if ISIS can hold Mosul and consolidate its presence there, it will have taken a giant step towards its goal of creating an Islamist emirate that straddles Iraq and Syria, where insurgents control a large swathe of territory. \n \n Fears of ISIS sparking a wider Sunni uprising have increased with reports that former Baath Party members loyal to Saddam Hussein have joined forces with the jihadists. \n \n One resident in Tikrit, Saddam Hussein's former hometown, told the AP news agency that fighters raised posters of the former dictator after driving the army out. \n \n The United Nations Security Council said on Thursday it unanimously supported Iraq's government and people in their \"fight against terrorism\". \n \n Earlier it said the humanitarian situation around Mosul, from where up to 500,000 people have fled, was \"dire and... worsening by the moment\". \n \n Analysis: Jeremy Bowen, BBC Middle East editor \n \n If ISIS can hold Mosul and consolidate its presence there it will have taken a giant step towards its goal of creating an Islamist emirate that straddles Iraq and Syria. \n \n It would be the most significant act by a jihadist group since al-Qaeda attacked the US on 11 September 2001. It could also lead to other changes on the borders Britain and France imposed on the Middle East a century ago, starting with break-up of Iraq on sectarian lines. \n \n The success of ISIS can only make the turmoil in the Middle East worse. ISIS is an ultra extremist Sunni Muslim group. Its success will deepen the sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shias that is already the most dangerous fault line in the Middle East. \n \n Iran, which is a majority Shia Muslim country, shares a border with Iraq. It has a direct line to Iraq's Shia Muslim Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki, and close links with some Iraqi Shia militias. The Iranians could direct their proxies, and even their own special forces units, at ISIS. \n \n That might end up further inflaming the anger of Iraqi Sunnis, who have already helped the advance of ISIS through Iraq. \n \n US air strikes, if they happen, might do the same thing. Once again in the Middle East, the Americans have limited options. Its invasion and occupation of Iraq in 2003 helped create and strengthen jihadist groups. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Iraq's former PM Ayad Allawi says the country could be facing a break-up as a result of the insurgency led by Islamist militants \n \n Insurgent advance \n \n \"There will be some short-term immediate things that need to be done militarily,\" Mr Obama told reporters at the White House as he met Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott. \n \n \"I don't rule out anything because we do have a stake in making sure these jihadists are not getting a permanent foothold in Iraq, or Syria for that matter.\" \n \n White House spokesman Jay Carney subsequently added that President Obama was referring to not ruling out air strikes. \"We are not contemplating ground troops,\" he said. \n \n Iraq's ambassador to the US, Lukman Faily, earlier told the BBC this was the \"most serious situation\" faced by the country in recent years. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption Iraq state TV airs footage said to be airstrikes on the ISIS-held city of Mosul \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption Iraqis gathered at the army's recruitment centre in Baghdad, after officials urged them to fight the militants \n \n Image copyright AFP Image caption Footage allegedly showing captured vehicles of Iraqi security forces with the ISIS flag in Mosul \n \n A parliamentary vote to grant PM Maliki emergency powers was delayed earlier after MPs failed to turn up. \n \n Just 128 out of the 325 MPs were present for the vote. \n \n Correspondents say the failure of the Iraqi parliament to achieve a quorum to vote on emergency powers says much about the fragmented state of Iraqi politics. \n \n In the north of the country, Kurdish forces have claimed control of the oil city of Kirkuk, saying government forces have fled. \n \n The Kurds - seen as a bulwark against the Sunni Muslim insurgents - have also been locked for years in a dispute with Baghdad over Kirkuk, seeking to incorporate it into their own autonomous area. \n \n Media playback is unsupported on your device Media caption The BBC's Rami Ruhayem reports from Irbil in Kurdish-run northern Iraq, as an audio recording of ISIS spokesman Abu Muhammad al-Adnani is released \n \n They are clearly happy to fill the vacuum left in Kirkuk, an area they historically claim as theirs, the BBC's Jim Muir reports from Kurdish-run Irbil. \n \n Iraqi government forces slowed the insurgents' advance on Wednesday outside Samarra, a city just 110km (68 miles) north of Baghdad. \n \n But reports have emerged of the rebels bypassing Samarra and seizing the town of Dhuluiya, 90km north-west of the capital. \n \n Security in Baghdad has been stepped up after a video emerged of the militants threatening to march on the city. \n \n ISIS in Iraq \n \n Image copyright AP Image caption An Islamist fighter near a burning Iraqi army Humvee in Tikrit \n \n The Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant (ISIS) has 3,000 to 5,000 fighters, and grew out of an al-Qaeda-linked organisation in Iraq \n \n ISIS has exploited the standoff between the Iraqi government and the minority Sunni Arab community, which complains that Shia Prime Minister Nouri Maliki is monopolising power \n \n It has already taken over Ramadi and Falluja, but taking over Mosul is its greatest achievement \n \n The organisation is led by Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, an obscure figure regarded as a battlefield commander and tactician who was once the leader of al-Qaeda in Iraq, one of the groups that later became ISIS. \n \n Critical test ahead for Iraq \n \n Six things that went wrong for Iraq \n \n How did Iraqi militants take over Mosul? \n \n In pictures: Iraq cities attacked",

        "Document": "OKLAHOMA CITY, OK (CNN) -- An Oklahoma congressional candidate has announced plans to contest Tuesday's primary election of long time Representative Frank Lucas. Tim Murray says he doesn't feel Lucas is qualified for office. \n \n Congressman Frank Lucas has been releasing several campaign commercials in the Oklahoma City area, but his opponent this election, Tim Murray, isn't buying that this guy is the real deal. \n \n Murray brings it up in his letter announcing his plan to contest Lucas' election writing \"...it is widely known Rep. Frank d. Lucas is no longer alive and has been displayed by a look alike.\" \n \n Oklahoma station KFOR tried contacting Murray numerous times after he mailed the letter to their station, but he didn't return any messages. \n \n But his campaign website goes into detail about his theory that Lucas was hanged \"...executed by the world court on or about Jan. 11, 2011...\" in Ukraine. \n \n For the past 20 years, Lucas has been in congress and he's faced Murray in past elections. Lucas said, \"He was the Democratic nominee for congress two years ago. This time, he chose to run as a Republican.\" \n \n On Tuesday, five percent of Oklahomans voted for Murray and Lucas won, but since Murray believes Lucas is a fake, he wants those votes. Lucas said, \"Many things have been said about me, said to me during course of my campaigns. This is the first time I've ever been accused of being a body double or a robot.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://on.kthv.com/1lJr0Qg ||||| Oklahoma Rep. Frank Lucas won his Republican primary with 82.8 percent of the vote on Tuesday. His opponent, Timothy Ray Murray, only received 5.2 percent of the vote. \n \n Murray is taking his loss, well, oddly. He's contesting the election results on the grounds that Lucas is dead and has been replaced by a body double. Lucas, who has been in Congress for 20 years, told local news station KFOR that \u201cIt does come as kind of a shock to read that you\u2019re not you.\" \n \n \"A lot of stupid things happen in Oklahoma politics,\" says Keith Gaddie at the University of Oklahoma, \"but this may be the stupidest I've ever heard. Welcome to Oklahoma.\" (At the end of our phone call, Gaddie asked that I make sure the word \"stupid\" appeared in his quote.) \n \n Paul Ziriax at the Oklahoma State Election Board says that Murray has not filed a formal petition to challenge the results yet. He has until 5 p.m. today to make a decision. The deadline for challenging the qualifications of a candidate was April 15. \n \n In a press release on Murray's campaign Web site -- addressed to \"News Person\" -- he asserts that \"it is widely known Rep. Frank D. Lucas is no longer alive and has been displayed by a look alike. Rep. Lucas\u2019 look alike was depicted as sentenced on a white stage in southern Ukraine on or about Jan. 11, 2011.\" \n \n Stacy Buck, a representative for Lucas, confirms that yes, the congressman is alive, and no, he has never been to Ukraine, but that the office is making no further comments at this time. \n \n Although the specifics of Murray's claim are slightly different, the candidate's fears closely follow the plot of the 1993 movie \"Dave,\" which has a 94 percent \"Fresh\" rating on Rotten Tomatoes -- and a thumbs-up from Bill Clinton. In the movie, Dave Kovic -- played by Kevin Kline, fills in for the president -- who also looks eerily like Kevin Kline -- after he suffers a stroke. \n \n Saddam Hussein's rumored body doubles were featured in an episode of \"Arrested Development.\" \n \n Murray also reaffirms his qualifications for office, as a human who is alive. \"I will never use a look alike to replace my (The Office\u2019s) message to you or to anyone else, as both the other Republican Challengers have.\" \n \n The accusations leveled against Lucas have been on Murray's campaign website for a long time, but did not receive any attention until Murray sent out a press release after the primary. In previous web site updates, Murray promises, \"I will NEVER use Artificial Intelligence look alike to voice what The Representative\u2019s Office is doing nor own a robot look alike.\" ||||| The seed for this crawl was a list of every host in the Wayback Machine \n \n This crawl was run at a level 1 (URLs including their embeds, plus the URLs of all outbound links including their embeds) \n \n The WARC files associated with this crawl are not currently available to the general public.",

        "Document": "By Phil Williams \n \n Chief Investigative Reporter \n \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Are leaders of a for-profit public school trying to hide the fact their students are failing? \n \n That's the question that some are asking tonight as a result of an email uncovered by NewsChannel 5 Investigates. \n \n At the center of the controversy is the Tennessee Virtual Academy -- a for-profit, online public school that Republican lawmakers touted as a way to improve education in Tennessee. Two years ago, state lawmakers voted to let K12 Inc. open the school, using millions of taxpayer dollars. \n \n But, now, those lawmakers are concerned about standardized test results that put it among the worst schools in the state. \n \n In fact, the email suggests that even school leaders are becoming increasingly concerned by how their students' grades may look to parents and the public. \n \n \"That is not something I would ever be told in my school -- I mean, it's just not acceptable,\" said state Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Knoxville Democrat who is also a career teacher. \"Quite honestly, I was horrified.\" \n \n The email -- labeled \"important -- was written in December by the Tennessee Virtual Academy's vice principal to middle school teachers. \n \n \"After ... looking at so many failing grades, we need to make some changes before the holidays,\" the email begins. \n \n Among the changes: Each teacher \"needs to take out the October and September progress [reports]; delete it so that all that is showing is November progress.\" \n \n \"Does it talk about we need to make changes in curriculum? Does it talk about we need to make changes in our teaching strategy? No,\" Rep. Johnson observed. \"Those changes we need to make are deleting grades from the computer system.\" \n \n \"And that's cheating in your mind?\" NewsChannel 5 Investigates asked. \n \n \"In my mind, sure. I mean, yes.\" \n \n The email adds, \"This cannot be late!\" \n \n \"To come in and say 'everybody who made failing grades the first two months, we need to delete those grades,' to me that's a huge issue,\" Johnson added. \n \n And the suggestions from K12 leaders don't end there. \n \n In traditional classrooms, if students score a 60 on one test and a 90 on a second test, they're stuck with a 75 average. But the email suggests that teachers erase the bad grades, leaving students with just the good grades. \n \n The email continues, \"If you have given an assignment and most of your students failed that assignment, then you need to take that grade out.\" \n \n Read the TNVA email, response \n \n \"This doesn't say give them a second chance,\" we noted. \n \n \"No, it does not,\" the lawmaker agreed. \"It just says take that out. To me, this appears like it's grade fixing.\" \n \n K12 officials refused to sit down to answer our questions, but the Tennessee Virtual Academy's principal said in an email that the goal was to \"more accurately recognize students' current progress.\" \n \n \"By going back into our school's electronic grading system and recording students' most recent progress score (instead of taking the average throughout the semester) we could more accurately recognize students' current progress in their individualized learning program,\" principal Josh Williams said in the statement. \n \n \"This also helped differentiate those and identify those who needed instructional intervention and remediation.\" \n \n Williams compared K12's grade deletions to the \"common practice in traditional schools\" of allowing \"make-up tests, alternative assessments and extra credit opportunities.\" \n \n Yet, the internal email also suggests that Virtual Academy teachers had already attempted those sorts of efforts to boost student grades. \n \n \"In early December, all teachers gave their students an opportunity to improve their grades by giving additional assignments,\" it says. \n \n \"Yet, we are still seeing failing grades.\" \n \n As to K12's explanation, Mitchell Johnson, interim director of the Tennessee Education Association, questioned how deleting data helps K12 to better understand students' needs. \n \n \"They're probably changing the grades to make themselves look better,\" he speculated. \n \n It's a practice that the TEA official suggested would not sit well with privatization advocates if they saw a \"delete it\" email from a traditional public school. \n \n \"I think that they would be incensed, and I'm hoping that the reformers will be as incensed about what has happened here -- as they would be if it had happened within a public school setting,\" he added. \n \n In the email, teachers were also told that their main focus is on reading and math -- and that they are not as concerned about students making F's in history and science. \n \n But the principal of the Tennessee Virtual Academy noted that, ultimately, the school's success or failure will be judged based on the standardized tests that students take at the end of the year -- not on individual grades. \n \n Because of concerns about the Tennessee Virtual Academy's performance, Gov. Bill Haslam has proposed legislation that would cap the number of students who could enroll at 5,000. It's at about 3,200 right now. \n \n There is also a bill up in a House subcommittee Tuesday that would essentially shut it down. \n \n E-mail: pwilliams@newschannel5.com ||||| Humphrey on the Hill Tom Humphrey's blog on politics and legislative news in Tennessee \n \n NASHVILLE \u2014 A House committee killed legislation that would have closed Union County-based Tennessee Virtual Academy on Tuesday after one Knoxville legislator effectively blocked another from talking to the committee about allegations that the for-profit school altered the bad grades of some students. \n \n Instead, the House Education Subcommittee approved a bill pushed by Gov. Bill Haslam's administration that puts some new restrictions on virtual schools, but only after eliminating \u2014 with the governor's approval \u2014 a proposed 5,000-student enrollment cap that was originally part of House Bill 151. \n \n Democratic Rep. Mike Stewart of Nashville sponsored the bill (HB728) that would have effectively repealed the law passed in 2011 that allowed for-profit virtual schools to operate in Tennessee. \n \n The 2011 bill was sponsored by Rep. Harry Brooks, R-Knoxville, who is now chairman of the House Education Committee and sponsor of the Haslam administration bill changing some rules for running virtual schools. \n \n Stewart told the committee that Tennessee Virtual Academy, part of a system of virtual schools operated around the nation by K12 Inc., has proved itself in a year of operation a \"bad idea\" for both its students, who have had low scores in testing, and for taxpayers. \n \n \"The only people that are benefiting are in K12, a Virginia corporation that is rising statewide to siphon off millions of dollars every year ... for enormous profits,\" said Stewart, adding that K12 CEO Ronald Packard was paid $3.9 million last year and $5 million the year before. \n \n Rep. Roger Kane, R-Knoxville, told Stewart his talk of Packard's salary was a \"red herring\" and otherwise criticized the Nashville lawmaker's statements \u2014 drawing applause from perhaps 25 Virtual Academy teachers, students and parents of students in the audience. \n \n One Virtual Academy teacher, Summer Shelton of Knoxville, told the panel she had taught in Knox County and elsewhere \u2014 including Europe \u2014 and considered the academy as having \"the most dynamic curriculum\" and the best overall, especially beneficial to children with special problems, such as feeling stressed in regular schools. \n \n Legislative staff found that Tennessee Virtual Academy is receiving $7.5 million in state funding this year. \n \n Stewart told the committee that the company receives $5,300 per student \"essential to turn on a website\" and has refused to give any information on how much it spends \u2014 which he estimated at $1,000 to $2,000 per student. He challenged K12 to provide the information, though there was no response during the session. \n \n After the meeting, Ken Meyer, director of government relations for K12, told reporters that Stewart's figures are wrong and K12 has lost money in its first year of operation. \n \n Actually, he said the Tennessee operation gets $4,700 per student, gives Union County about $300 in accordance with its contract, and thus receives only about $4,400 per student. Meyer said the company's costs are about $6,600 per student, adding he was going by memory and would give more precise figures later. \n \n Stewart also cited an email sent to Virtual Academy teachers in December that says they should \"take out the October and September progress (reports); delete it so that all that is showing is November progress reports.\" \n \n He distributed the email, which was provided by Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, to him and to WTVF-TV in Nashville, which aired a report on the matter Monday evening. Johnson, a Knox County schoolteacher, said she had been given the email by a Virtual Academy teacher. \n \n Stewart asked that Johnson be allowed to speak to the committee. Brooks objected, saying the email had nothing to do with the Stewart bill under discussion. The committee chairman made a motion to end all discussion and proceed immediately to a vote on the bill. \n \n Rep. Mark White, R-Memphis, presiding at the subcommittee meeting, promptly declared Brooks' motion approved by voice vote, then immediately called for a vote on the bill. It was declared defeated on voice vote. \n \n Afterward, Johnson and Shelton spent several minutes discussing the email, which Shelton said had been misunderstood. She said the school had a new \"grade book\" for teachers to report student progress. Some teachers were averaging grades while others were using the most recent grade, Shelton said. The email was to clarify that the most recent grade \u2014 as a measure of progress \u2014 should be used, she said. In many situations, she said the student had taken a test twice, in which case the second grade is used. \n \n After hearing out Shelton, Johnson said she understood much of the lengthy explanation, but overall \"it's not quite jiving 100 percent.\" She also questioned why K12 or Virtual Academy executives had not testified or answered questions. \n \n The Haslam administration bill, sponsored by Brooks, was approved on a 6-3 vote. \n \n As amended, it imposes a 1,500-student cap on new virtual schools launched in the state, but not on those already operating. The original bill would have covered Tennessee Virtual Academy \u2014 which now has about 3,200 students \u2014 with a 5,000 cap. That was dropped by an amendment. \n \n The bill has other provisions that declare a virtual school that has below-standard student performance for two consecutive years can be closed by the state's education commission. \n \n The commissioner would also have the option to instead impose an enrollment cap.",

Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said this afternoon that the victims ranged from 5 years old to 72 years old. \n \n A law enforcement official reports that 26 people are dead and about 20 others were injured. \n \n The fatality count makes it one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history. ||||| (CNN) At least 26 people were killed in Sunday's church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said at a press conference. \n \n About 20 others were wounded, said Freeman Martin, a regional director with the Texas Department of Public Safety, with victims ranging in age from 5 to 72 years old. \n \n Among the dead is the 14-year-old daughter of the First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, according to his wife, Sherri Pomeroy, the girl's mother. The couple were traveling out of state when the shooting occurred. \n \n Authorities have not said what may have motivated the suspected shooter, who was later found dead in his vehicle. \n \n The shooting has devastated the small Texas town east of San Antonio, described as a place where \"everybody knows everybody.\" \n \n Here are the latest developments: \n \n The suspected shooter has been identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, according to two law enforcement sources who have been briefed on the investigation. \n \n In April 2016, Kelley purchased the Ruger AR-556 rifle he used in the shooting from an Academy Sports & Outdoors store in San Antonio, Texas, a law enforcement official said. He indicated he didn't have a disqualifying criminal history when he filled out the background check paperwork at the store, the official said. Kelley listed a Colorado Springs, Colorado, address when he bought the gun. \n \n Kelley was a member of the US Air Force and served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge, according to Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. \n \n Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for assault on his spouse and assault on their child, according to Stefanek. Kelley served a year in prison and received a bad conduct discharge in 2014, the spokeswoman said. His rank was also reduced, she said. \n \n Speaking from Japan, President Donald Trump condemned the shooting as an \"act of evil\" and called it \"horrific.\" \n \n \"We don't know names of any of the victims at this time,\" said Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt in a press conference Sunday evening. As victims are identified, next of kin will be notified, he said. \n \n The attack \n \n Without naming Kelley, Martin described the shooter in Sunday's press conference as a young white male who was dressed in all-black \"tactical-type gear\" and wearing a ballistic vest. \n \n Martin said the suspect was seen in a Valero gas station across the street from the church in Sutherland Springs at about 11:20 a.m. local time on Sunday morning. \n \n The suspect left the gas station, crossed the street, exited his vehicle and began firing before he entered the church, Martin said. \n \n As the suspected shooter left the church, a local resident used their own rifle to engage him, Martin said. The shooter then fled the church, while the citizen pursued him. \n \n After a brief chase, law enforcement later found the suspect dead of a gunshot wound inside his vehicle. A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said multiple weapons were found in Kelley's car. Authorities said they don't know if the wound was self-inflicted or the result of the resident who fired on the suspect, Martin said. \n \n The shooter was killed after a brief chase north into neighboring Guadalupe County, Guadalupe County Sheriff's Office spokesman Robert Murphy said earlier on Sunday. \n \n The community \n \n Sutherland Springs is in Wilson County, about 30 miles east of San Antonio. \n \n \"My heart is broken,\" Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr. told CNN. \"We never think where it can happen, and it does happen. It doesn't matter where you're at. In a small community, real quiet and everything, and look at this.\" \n \n Dana Fletcher, who owns a business down the road from the church, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield that Sutherland Springs is a \"very small\" but \"very tight-knit community.\" \n \n \"There's two gas stations, the church, a community center, post office, a Dollar General, a tire shop,\" she said. \"That's about it.\" \n \n The FBI was on the scene of the shooting, according to Michelle Lee, spokeswoman for the FBI's San Antonio field office. Agents from the San Antonio field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also headed to the scene, a law enforcement source said. \n \n After the shooting, about 100 family members of victims gathered in a community center next to the church, waiting for news of their loved ones, 26-year-old David Flores told CNN. Local law enforcement, the FBI and the Red Cross were also at the community center. \n \n \"My dad saw the gunman run into the church building and then he heard shots and saw people running,\" Flores told CNN. \"People covered in blood and screaming.

To mark the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting, it is being republished. \n \n Sandy Hook Promise, an organization devoted to protecting children from gun violence that was launched in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, has issued a powerful public service announcement urging people to look for warning signs of potential shooters. \n \n Get push notifications with news, features and more. \n \n In the Dec. 2 PSA, part of the organization\u2019s \u201cKnow the Signs\u201d campaign, viewers are introduced to Evan, a typical teenager, trying to find summer love as the school year winds down. We see Evan scratch \u201cI am bored\u201d into a desk in his school\u2019s library, and he returns the next day to find a response from a female student. \n \n Evan and the mystery girl scratch flirtatious messages back and forth, and Evan tries to find out who his secret pen pal is. On the final day of school, as yearbooks are being passed around for signatures, Evan\u2019s chat partner recognizes his handwriting and reveals herself. But while she does, an ominous figure emerges through a door in the background, drops a large duffel bag, and cocks an assault rifle. \n \n Viewers are then shown a shortened version of the same PSA: The message is that while viewers were distracted by Evan\u2019s romance, they neglected the warning signs of a male student in the background who reads gun-enthusiast magazines, searches for gun videos on YouTube, and is bullied in the school\u2019s halls. Towards the end of the PSA, viewers see the male student make a menacing gesture towards his teacher after receiving a poor test grade. \n \n Text appears in the ad: \u201cWhile you were watching Evan, another student was showing signs of planning a shooting.

The video follows a boy, Evan (the same name as the video), exchanging messages on a desk in the school library with an unknown classmate. \n \n The flirtatious messages are sent back and forth until the end of the school year, leaving a dissuaded Evan without a chance to learn the identity of his secret crush. However, in a last-ditch effort to learn who the person is, he exchanges yearbook signatures with classmates \u2014 one of which recognizes his handwriting from the desk. \n \n While the two begin talking, however, an ominous figure emerges from the entrance of the building, taking out an assault rifle and cocks the gun as the screen fades to black. \n \n \"While you were watching Evan, another student was showing signs of planning a shooting,\" the corresponding text reads. \"But no one noticed.\" \n \n The PSA then relays the scenes of Evan at school, and in the background are several alarming signs of another student looking at gun videos on YouTube, being bullied by classmates, sharing photos with a gun on Instagram and reading a gun enthusiast magazine. \n \n Giphy The warning signs \n \n \"It's important to know that one warning sign on its own does not mean a person is planning an act of violence,\" the Sandy Hook Promise website reads under the \"Know the Signs\" program. \"But when many connected or cumulative signs are observed over a period of time, it could mean that the person is heading down a pathway towards violence or self-harm.

        "Document": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 The Utah Legislature passed a bill Wednesday that eliminates the statute of limitations for lawsuits against perpetrators of child sexual abuse. \n \n Deondra Brown, co-founder of the nonprofit Foundation for Survivors of Abuse, watched from the Senate gallery as lawmakers engaged in a final debate before voting to pass HB277 and sending it to Gov. Gary Herbert for his signature. \n \n \u201cOn behalf of victims across the state of Utah, we\u2019re excited to know that we can kind of breathe, take our time in healing, and come forward and tackle that big legal case when and if we are every ready,\u201d Brown said. \n \n Brown has followed the progress of HB277 and testified in favor of the bill at committee meetings throughout the legislative process. Three Brown sisters, members of the 5 Browns piano quintet, were molested by their father, Keith Brown, as children. The sisters sought criminal charges in 2010 against their father, who had also been their professional manager. \n \n Keith Brown was sentenced in March 2011 to 10 years to life for sodomy on a child, a first-degree felony, and one to 15 years each on two counts of sex abuse of a child, a second-degree felony. The crimes occurred when the girls were 13 years old or younger. \n \n Current Utah law limits civil actions to four years after a victim\u2019s 18th birthday. HB277 would remove those limitations and allow victims time to heal and muster the courage and maturity to take civil action and hold their abusers accountable, said bill sponsor Rep. Ken Ivory, R-West Jordan. \n \n \u201cSomeone that victimizes a child should never be able to hide behind time \u2014 ever,\u201d Ivory said. \n \n The bill\u2019s floor sponsor, Sen. Aaron Osmond, R-South Jordan, said 1 in 6 boys and 1 in 4 girls in Utah will suffer or have suffered from sexual abuse. He added that most children who are sexually abused don\u2019t come to a realization or the ability to deal with the experience until after age 40. \n \n The bill gives victims a four-year window from the time of discovery or remembrance of the child abuse experience to file civil action, Osmond said, allowing them to overcome emotional obstacles that often bar them from taking action. \n \n As a result, perpetrators could be susceptible to lawsuits for crimes committed years ago, Ivory said. \n \n Sen. Scott Jenkins, R-Plain City, argued against HB277, saying the statute of limitations was put in place for a reason and citing cases where individuals who realized repressed memories of child sexual abuse, but later discovered them to be wrong. He said he\u2019s \u201cnot for abuse by any means,\u201d but he\u2019s concerned about what the bill would allow. \n \n Sen. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City, joined Jenkins in voting against the bill. \n \n After the Senate\u2019s vote, Deondra Brown said victims of child sexual abuse shouldn\u2019t have a \u201cdoor closed in their face\u201d because of time limits, and they should be granted the option if or when they decide they want to file civil actions against perpetrators. \n \n She said victims deal with medical bills and health issues for \u201cthe rest of their lives\u201d and shouldn\u2019t have to shoulder the burden of paying for it, which she said costs the average victim up to $1 million over the course of their lives. \n \n Victims should be allowed to pursue a case that would hold the perpetrator accountable and relieve that financial burden, Deondra Brown said. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re the ones that inflicted this upon us to begin with,\u201d she said. \n \n When asked if she would consider civil action against her father, Deondra Brown said she had talked about a civil case several years ago with her siblings, but they felt as though they \u201cwere able to get the case that (they) needed though the criminal side of things.\" \n \n \u201cBut honestly, I don\u2019t know where I would be 10 years from now if that\u2019s something I would still like to be able to explore,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love to be able to have that option in the state of Utah.\u201d \n \n The Senate's final vote on the bill was 24-2. \n \n Email: kmckellar@deseretnews.com ||||| RANDOLPH, Rich County \u2014 Under strong words from a judge and years of pain from his former student, a retired Rich High School teacher has been sentenced to prison for sexually assaulting the woman 22 years ago. \n \n Michael Layne Williamson, 60, spoke of shame, pain and forgiveness as he appeared before 1st District Judge Thomas Willmore for sentencing on July 27. The former teacher pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, one second-degree felony, while the other was reduced to a third-degree felony. \n \n No details of the case were released when Williamson was originally charged in November, and requests by the Deseret News to the Rich County sheriff's and attorney's offices for police documents were denied. Inquiries about appealing the denial were ignored. \n \n In an audio recording of Williamson's sentencing hearing, the judge \u2014 unmoved by Williamson's apologies and scolding him for calling his actions a mistake \u2014 sentenced the former teacher to one to 15 years, with an additional term of up to five years to run concurrently. While in prison he must complete a sex offender course. \n \n A pre-sentence report had recommended 210 days in jail for Williamson, his attorneys explained, asking that he be able to serve his time in home confinement as he battles stage 4 prostate cancer. Prosecutors did not ask for a specific punishment for Williamson, saying they left the decision to the judge's discretion. \n \n Willmore scoffed at the short recommended sentence, which he attributed to the Justice Reinvestment Initiative and efforts to reduce prison populations. He based his sentence on the girl's young age, the position of trust that Williamson held, and the way he disgraced the \"noble profession\" of a teacher. \n \n Reading from an apology letter describing the remorse and shame that he, too, has lived with, Williamson said in the hearing, \"This indiscretion of mine was of the most heinous type.\" \n \n Willmore interrupted at that moment. \n \n \"Let me stop you right there. It is not an indiscretion. You broke the law. And I heard from many of these letters from your family that it was a mistake,\" the judge said. \n \n \"A mistake means unintended consequences or a lapse of judgement,\" he continued, pounding his hand for emphasis. \"That's far beyond a lack of judgment and indiscretion. You and your family tried to sweep this under the rug, tried to downplay this.\" \n \n In an emotional testimony, the woman, now 35, showed the judge a picture of herself in eighth grade to reinforce that it wasn't an adult who was victimized, it was a child. \n \n \"You pushed forward little by little until I was so deep in that there was no way out. You were my teacher, my friend's dad, an adult, all of those people I was taught to respect and to listen to and to trust,\" the woman said. \"You used all of it to satisfy your own perverted desires. You made sure I knew how much I would ruin everyone's life and everything around me if I ever told anyone. You made sure I knew how much you stood to lose if anyone ever found out. \n \n \"You put it all on my shoulders, those of a 13-year-old, to carry. I always blamed myself.\" \n \n The woman, who the Deseret News has chosen not to name, explained that she kept her silence about what happened between her and her teacher, eventually leaving the state. On a recent trip back to Utah, however, the pain came rushing back, and she said she made a choice: Report the abuse to law enforcement or take her own life. \n \n \"Since breaking my silence I have attempted to begin processing everything I have pushed aside for two decades,\" she said, describing the blame, anger, hurt and embarrassment she long believed was of her own making. \"I am 35 years old and I am now just starting to understand those things are a reflection of you and not me.\" \n \n Among the greatest challenges since coming forward, the woman said, has been battling the panic she now feels seeing her own children go to school or activities knowing that she, at their age, was not safe. \n \n \"With my knowledge of the evil that is out there, I feel helpless in protecting them when I couldn't even protect myself,\" she said. \"So many times I have broken down crying when I am talking to my kids about boundaries and how to keep their bodies safe, telling them that no matter what anyone else tells them it is not their fault.\" \n \n In his statement, Williamson apologized to the court, the community, his church and the school district. He called on the woman and her family to do what he called one of the hardest things they may ever face: forgive him. \n \n \"I am so sorry for the pain and anguish I have caused you,\" he said, calling the woman by name. \"I sincerely apologize for every out-of-line thought, action and deed which I committed. I truly wished you no harm and had no intention of hurting you so severely. I was reckless with our student-teacher relationship and ignored the values and principles that I truly believe in and cherish.\" \n \n In several moments, Williamson spoke of his faith in God and his belief that forgiveness is possible. \n \n \"The future is ahead and the past is in the past,\" Williamson concluded. \"My hope and prayer is that through these proceedings we can all find closure and live courageously into life ahead. Our lives and our families have been irreversibly changed by my actions of 20 years ago. My earnest prayer is that all of us can move forward from this spot and create our own personal future full of love, forgiveness and healing.\" \n \n Email: mromero@deseretnews.com, Twitter: McKenzieRomero",

        "Document": "(CNN) The shooting at the Tree of Life synagogue in Pittsburgh -- in which the death toll now stands at 11 -- is believed to be the deadliest attack on the Jewish community in the history of the US, the Anti-Defamation League said. \n \n \"It is simply unconscionable for Jews to be targeted during worship on a Sabbath morning, and unthinkable that it would happen in the United States of America in this day and age,\" the Jewish organization, which tracks anti-Semitic incidents, said in a statement \n \n Until now, the deadliest attack specifically targeting Jews happened in 1985 when a Seattle lawyer Charles Goldmark was bludgeoned and stabbed to death, along with his wife, Annie, and their two sons, the ADL said. David Morse Rice, a drifter and unemployed steelworker, was found guilty of those killings. \n \n Anti-Semitic incidents and online harassment rising, ADL says \n \n The ADL said the attack Saturday comes at a time when both anti-Semitic incidents and online harassment are on the rise. \n \n Jewish people were the victims of more reported hate crimes than any other religious minority in 2016, according to the most recent year of FBI statistics. \n \n In that year , 684 anti-Jewish incidents were reported. That's more than the rest of religiously motivated hate crimes combined, records reveal. \n \n Tracking such crimes can be nuanced and difficult. The motivations aren't always clear, and the crimes are often not reported by victims and police. \n \n Robert Bowers, 46, faces 29 charges in all, including 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder and multiple counts of two hate crimes: obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer. \n \n \"The crimes of violence are based upon the federal civil rights laws prohibiting hate crimes,\" US Attorney Scott W. Brady and Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of Pittsburgh office, said in a statement. \n \n The FBI, which calls an offense a hate crime when there's an added element of bias, is leading the investigation into the attack. \n \n Bowers told a SWAT officer that he wanted all Jews to die and also that Jews were committing genocide to his people, according to CNN affiliate WTAE, citing a police criminal complaint filed Saturday evening in Pittsburgh. \n \n Last year, The Anti-Defamation League reported, anti-Semitic incidents rose almost 60% , the largest single-year increase on record. \n \n The ADL found 1,986 cases of harassment, vandalism or physical assaults against Jewish people or institutions in 2017. It found 1,267 in 2016. \n \n \"We're definitely in a period in our country where there's a general decrease in civility,\" Aryeh Tuchman, associate director for the ADL's Center on Extremism, said when the ADL released its findings in February. \"People in the past who have tamped down their anti-Semitic proclivities may feel more liberated to express them than before.\" \n \n 'An escalating scourge of hate-based violence' \n \n In a statement condemning the Pittsburgh attack, the Rabbinical Assembly said the shooting was a reminder that anti-Semitism \"is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades.\" \n \n \"This vicious hate crime, perpetrated against innocent people at prayer is but the latest in an escalating scourge of hate-based violence in America,\" it said. \n \n Moishe Bane, president of the Orthodox Union, expressed heartbreak for \"the senseless murder of our fellow Jews and all victims of vicious hate crimes.\" \n \n \"We condemn the dangerous rhetoric that foments such senseless violence and we stand with the Tree of Life Congregation and the whole Pittsburgh community at this terrible time,\" he said. \n \n Rabbi Elazar Muskin, president of the Rabbinical Council of America said \"fringe elements of society\" had become \"emboldened by speech which is often disrespectful and hateful.\" \n \n FBI says reports of hate crimes have increased \n \n The FBI showed an overall increase in reported hate crimes of more than 4% from 2015 to 2016. \n \n Anti-Islamic (anti-Muslim) crimes accounted for 307, up 19% from the previous year. That was the biggest percentage rise. \n \n The FBI also tracks religiously motivated crimes against Eastern Orthodox Christians, other Christians, Hindus, Sikhs, Mormons, Jehovah's Witnesses and Buddhists. \n \n In race categories, African Americans were targeted the most -- in about half of the reported 3,489 racially driven incidents in 2016. \n \n The FBI said 1,200 incidents were motivated by bias against victims based on sexual orientation or gender identity. ||||| The FBI investigates after an active shooter situation at the Tree of Life Congregation on Saturday, Oct. 27, 2018, in the Squirrel Hill section of Pittsburgh.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (Associated Press) \n \n PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 During the week, anyone who wanted to get inside Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue had to ring the doorbell and be granted entry by staff because the front door was kept locked. Not so on Saturday \u2014 the Jewish Sabbath \u2014 when the building was open for worship. \n \n A gunman who had expressed hatred of Jews exploited that vulnerability, so common in so many houses of worship across the country, in a singularly horrific way. \n \n Armed with a rifle and three handguns, Robert Bowers walked into the synagogue during Saturday morning worship and began shooting, killing 11 and wounding six before police took him into custody, officials said. It was the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history, according to the leader of the Anti-Defamation League. \n \n Bowers traded gunfire with police and was shot multiple times but survived. He was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts, including weapons offenses and hate crimes. Law enforcement officials planned to discuss the massacre at a news conference Sunday morning. \n \n Four police officers were among the wounded. \n \n The nation's latest mass shooting drew condemnation and expressions of sympathy from politicians and religious leaders of all stripes. With the midterm election just over a week away, it also reignited a longstanding and bitter debate over guns. President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue \"had some kind of protection\" from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, up for re-election, noted that once again \"dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm's way.\" \n \n Calling the shooting an \"evil anti-Semitic attack,\" Trump ordered flags at federal buildings throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in respect for the victims. He said he planned to travel to Pittsburgh, but offered no details. \n \n In the city, thousands gathered for a vigil Saturday night. Some blamed the slaughter on the nation's political climate. \n \n \"When you spew hate speech, people act on it. Very simple. And this is the result. A lot of people dead. Senselessly,\" said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, which rents space at Tree of Life. \n \n The shooting raised immediate alarm in Jewish communities around the country. Authorities in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and other cities sent extra patrols to synagogues and other houses of worship. \n \n Little was known about Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record but who is believed to have expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on social media. Authorities said it appears he acted alone. \n \n Worshippers \"were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith,\" said Bob Jones, head of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, though he cautioned the shooter's full motive was not yet known. \n \n Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, pledged that \"justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe.\" \n \n It wasn't clear if Bowers had an attorney to speak on his behalf. \n \n The gunman targeted a building that housed three separate congregations, all of which were conducting Sabbath services when the attack began just before 10 a.m. in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. \n \n The synagogue door was unlocked on the Sabbath \"because people are coming for services, and the bell would be ringing constantly. So they do not lock the door, and anybody can just walk in,\" said Marilyn Honigsberg, administrative assistant for New Light. \"And that's what this man did.\" \n \n Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the Tree of Life, said synagogue officials had not gotten any threats that he knew of before the shooting. But he said security was a concern, and the synagogue had started working to improve it. \n \n \"You know, you're always worried that something would happen,\" said Myron Snider, head of the cemetery committee for New Light. Snider just got out of the hospital on Thursday and missed Saturday's service. \n \n \"But you never dream that it would happen like this,\" Snider added. \"Just never ever dream that it would happen like this.\" \n \n Zachary Weiss, 26, said his father, 60-year-old Stephen Weiss, was inside the synagogue but was unharmed. Weiss said his father told him that he and Tree of Life's rabbi helped congregants take shelter and follow the active shooter response training they'd received months earlier. Stephen Weiss made it out of the building and used a janitor's cellphone to call his family at home. \n \n The attack, his son vowed, \"will not define our congregation and will not define our city.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Breed reported from Raleigh, North Carolina, and Lauer reported from Philadelphia. Contributing to this report were Associated Press writers Mark Gillispie and Gene Puskar in Pittsburgh, Eric Tucker and Michael Balsamo in Washington, Marc Levy in Harrisburg, Michael Kunzelman in Silver Spring, Maryland, and Michael Rubinkam in northeastern Pennsylvania. \n \n ___ \n \n For AP's complete coverage of the Pittsburgh synagogue shootings: https://www.apnews.com/Shootings",

        "Document": "What is love bombing? \n \n Love bombing is a process of grooming in which a predator uses flattery, praise and the promise of a supreme alliance to fulfill their own agendas. By love bombing their victims, abusers are able to persuade their targets to fulfill their requests and desires. Love bombing is not only a tool used by covert manipulators to exploit their victims, it is also used in cults to ensure loyalty to the cult leader. In fact, there is much overlap between the behavior of cults and the abuse cycle of an abuser and his or her victim. \n \n While anyone can be the victim of love bombing, it has an especially powerful effect on children of narcissistic parents, because they have already been subconsciously programmed to seek approval, engage in people-pleasing habits and look for external validation as a way to survive their psychologically turbulent childhoods. \n \n When children of narcissists meet emotional predators in adulthood, they are especially susceptible to becoming ensnared in the web of a malignant narcissist. \n \n Love Bombing and Intermittent Reinforcement Work Together to Create an Environment of Uncertainty, Coercion and Control \n \n In a relationship with a pathological predator, love bombing is combined with intermittent reinforcement to create a sense of instability and longing in the victim. Intermittent reinforcement (in the context of psychological abuse) is a pattern of cruel, callous treatment mixed in with periodic affection. The abuser hands out \u201crewards\u201d such as affection, a compliment, or gifts sporadically and unpredictably throughout the abuse cycle. This causes the victim to perpetually seek their approval while settling for the crumbs of their occasional positive behavior. \n \n As author Adylen Birch writes, \u201cCreating fear of losing the relationship \u2013 and then relieving it periodically with episodes of love and attention \u2013 is the perfect manipulation.\u201d Much like the way a gambler at a slot machine becomes addicted to playing the game for a potential win despite the risk of major loss, a victim in the abuse cycle can become attached to the idea of getting a return on their \u201cinvestment\u201d in the relationship despite the toll it takes on their well-being. \n \n Intermittent reinforcement also affects our feelings towards our perpetrators, paradoxically bonding us more deeply to them and causing us to perceive their rare positive behaviors in an amplified way. Dr. Carver describes this as the \u201csmall kindness perception.\u201d As he notes in his article, \u201cLove and Stockholm Syndrome\u201d: \n \n In threatening and survival situations, we look for evidence of hope \u2013 a small sign that the situation may improve. When an abuser/controller shows the victim some small kindness, even though it is to the abusers benefit as well, the victim interprets that small kindness as a positive trait of the captor\u2026In relationships with abusers, a birthday card, a gift (usually provided after a period of abuse), or a special treat are interpreted as not only positive, but evidence that the abuser is not \u201call bad\u201d and may at some time correct his/her behavior. Abusers and controllers are often given positive credit for not abusing their partner, when the partner would have normally been subjected to verbal or physical abuse in a certain situation.\u201d \n \n Targets of emotional and psychological violence seek the love bombing that was so nourishing in the idealization phase, even as they are now being devalued and discarded by their abusers. This is not surprising, since love bombing, intermittent reinforcement and the effects of trauma work together to strengthen an intense trauma bond between target and abuser. \n \n There are three ways children of narcissists, who grow up scapegoated and diminished, are vulnerable to the tactics of love bombing. I discuss them below, as well as some \u201cimmunity methods\u201d to resist these manipulation tactics. \n \n 1. While hypercriticism puts us on the defensive, love-bombing disarms us initially. It mirrors our deepest desires to be wanted, desired, loved, cared for, heard and seen for who we truly are, down to every little nuance and quirk. \n \n When we are love bombed, there is an immediate sense of belonging and of kinship, something that is very attractive to children of narcissists, who feel very much like outcasts in their families as well as society. \n \n Narcissists and sociopaths are very good at \u201chooking\u201d us by pointing out our desirable physical attributes, personality traits, and/or accomplishments that deep down we want admired and recognized. At the same time, they fixate on those traits to further their own agenda, not because they actually care to know us deeply. They dig deep when they have to in order to get what they want (praise in return, sex, money, a place to live, etc.), but their affection for us is often short-lived and transient, escalating to contempt and envy should we ever threaten their sense of control over us. As Dr. Floyd (2013) writes: \n \n \u201cLove bombing is an extreme example of something that turns out to be relatively common\u2014something I call \u201ctoxic affection.\u201d If affection is the expression of love and fondness, then toxic affection is any such expression that has an ulterior motive. Perhaps I say I love you because I really do, and I want you to know that. Or, perhaps I say it only because I want to sleep with you, want to borrow money from you, or just want you to say it back to me. Using affection as a form of persuasion is often successful for the same reason that love bombing is: we want and need to be loved.\u201d \n \n Immunity method: Seek internal validation for those traits that you\u2019ve been love bombed with in the past. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t embody what the predator has flattered you with, but that you no longer need to depend on them for your sole source of self-esteem. Surround yourself with healthy people who recognize, rather than exploit, those qualities in you. Genuine compliments are given freely, without a need for you to do something in return or be a certain way for a person. Be alert to over the top flattery merged with a request and unwarranted praise. Even if the praise does seem warranted, just be aware that some (but certainly not all) praise has a hidden purpose. \n \n 2. Since children of narcissists are often triangulated by their parents, pitted against their own siblings, they fall for predators who make them feel special and unique. \n \n This is the type of attention that children of narcissists always craved to receive in childhood and they get plenty of validation from an emotional predator that grooms them. Yet they later become retraumatized by these same manipulators when they are \u201ctriangulated\u201d with former or new harem members and lovers. This causes targets of malignant narcissists to feel even more diminished and lacking, never feeling quite \u201cenough\u201d and feeling as if they have to compete with others in order to be seen as important. \n \n Immunity method: Pinpoint what makes you irreplaceable and resist comparing yourself to others negatively. Remember that you may be seeing an abuser\u2019s new shiny target or someone they triangulated you with fresh eyes, and you are unaware of what makes you truly beautiful and outstanding. Look at yourself with fresh eyes instead \u2013 if you were an outsider looking in, what amazing traits, talents and qualities would you notice about yourself? What makes you special and unique? \n \n Cultivate an authentic relationship with what makes you stand out and embrace visibility in areas where you may have previously hidden yourself to avoid the spotlight for fear of punishment or reprisal. Bring in healthier social feedback when needed to brainstorm what those areas could be. When you have a deep inner knowing that no one could ever replace you, you don\u2019t find it necessary for someone else to make you feel that way. \n \n You can then become much more selective about who you let into your life. Manipulative, toxic people can no longer gain easy access by just being charming or sweet \u2013 they have to show up and be there for you in real ways in order for you to take them seriously. \n \n 3. We mistake superficial alliances for deep, meaningful and once-in-a-lifetime connections. \n \n Children of narcissists are forced to navigate the world alone and become their own rugged heroes. We tend to our own wounds, our own scraped knees and emotional voids due to the necessity for survival. With no supportive caretakers to mend our aches in either childhood or adulthood, we find solace in even the most superficial of connections, holding onto them for indications that we have finally found a \u201chome\u201d for our tattered hearts and weary souls. \n \n As author Peg Streep writes in \u201cWhy Unloved Daughters Fall for Narcissists,\u201d we often don\u2019t notice the red flags as much as we do the potential for connection: \n \n \u201cBecause you\u2019re so hungry for love and connection\u2014and still trying to fill the hole in your heart left by an unloving mother\u2014you\u2019re likely not to notice how he amps the volume and drama. You stay focused on the make-up sex and the warm feelings of reassurance you feel when he tells you not to worry.\u201d \n \n Unfortunately, the fast-forwarding nature of the type of relationship that has love-bombing, mixed with the intense chemistry of finally being noticed and seen, makes for a rather addictive biochemical and psychological cocktail. We become addicted to the attention because we mistake it for authentic connection. \n \n Immunity method: Differentiate between connection and flattery early on to avoid investing in people who may not have your best interests at heart. Assess which relationships and friendships in your life have the capacity to grow into deeper alliances and which ones fall short of authentic partnership and true compatibility. The former usually takes some time to build and is built over time with someone who is trustworthy, consistent, transparent and reliable. The latter is often a quick fix or sleight of hand, a magic show followed by a disappearing act. \n \n Flattery, even if it is based on truly amazing qualities you might have, rarely lasts long-term. Connection, on the other hand, is built on a solid foundation \u2013 not just on empty compliments, but on genuine rapport, support, and intimacy. It involves two individuals who both share parts of themselves with vulnerability, along with a respect for personal boundaries and reciprocity. Connection, not crumbs, is what nourishes you long-term. Remember that you are truly worthy and deserving of nothing less. \n \n References \n \n Birch, A. (2016, December 18).

A surprise romantic getaway to a secluded countryside cottage for the weekend. A thoughtful phone call when you least expect it. All the signs of the beginning a of loving, caring relationship, right? \n \n Well, perhaps not. In fact, they might be signposts for the opposite, or what is commonly known as 'love bombing'. \n \n According to Dale Archer, a psychiatrist and author, 'love bombing' occurs when people are showered with over-the-top displays of attention and affection. And, we're not just talking romantic gestures and the occasional home-cooked meal, but romantic conversations, talks of the 'future' together, and constant contact via social media, phone calls and messages. The difference between a solid loving relationship and one that is subject to 'love bombing' is what happens next... \n \n ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \n \n More often than not, 'love bombing' is when these displays of 'affection' are grandiose and really over the top, leading people to quickly think they might have found their 'soul mate' or 'the one'. However, they soon find the loving, caring, affection, and understanding behaviour from their partner flips, resulting in unreasonable, controlling and manipulative traits. \n \n What is 'love bombing'? \n \n In essence, 'love bombing' is a form of conditioning tool (otherwise known as a form of abuse), whereby one person in the relationship drowns the other in displays of 'love' to maintain power and control. \n \n MOST POPULAR \n \n 'Healthy relationships build slowly, and are based on a series of actions, not a flood of words,' Archer writes for a blog post titled 'The Manipulative Partner's Most Devious Tactic' for Psychology Today. \n \n Rex Features \n \n The term is widely believed to have been first used by the Unification Church of the United States in the 1970s, whose cult leaders used love as a form of ammunition 'to con followers into committing mass suicide and murder', according to Archer. \n \n 'Pimps and gang leaders use 'love bombing' to encourage loyalty and obedience as well,' he writes. \n \n How does it work? \n \n First things first, all relationships are different and just because a partner showers you with love and affection does not mean they're narcissistic or have psychopathic tendencies that might lead to 'love bombing'. Some people genuinely are very loving and thoughtful and these sorts of gestures continue long into the relationship with no catch. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \n \n However, those who use 'love bombing' as a form of control often reinforce their love for their victim by showering them with affection when they act in a certain way that pleases the abuser, and later they will punish that person for behaving in a way that the abuser doesn't like. \n \n For example, an abuser will post an adorable snap of the two of you at dinner to Facebook, for all to see, with an equally mushy caption about how much you mean to him and how happy he is to be spending the evening with a gorgeous creature like you. The same person, though, when you head out for a dinner without him or go to a club with your friends, will call you ten times and accuse you of cheating/abandoning/not caring enough about him. \n \n ''Love bombing' works because humans have a natural need to feel good about who we are, and often we can't fill this need on our own,' writes Archer. \n \n How do you spot 'love-bombing'? \n \n Getting butterflies, falling head-over-heels, and feeling like you're falling madly in love with a new boyfriend/girlfriend is very normal in the early months of a relationship. \n \n But, according to Archer, potential love bombing victims often find themselves trapped into having constant contact with a partner, which ultimately convinces them the intensity of the communication is a sign of success and love.",
        "Summary": "Love bombing is a grooming process used by predators involving flattery, praise, and promises to fulfill their own agendas. It is also used in cults to ensure loyalty to the cult leader. Combined with intermittent reinforcement, which involves cruel treatment mixed with periodic affection, it creates a sense of instability and longing in the victim, leading to a trauma bond. Children of narcissists, who seek approval and validation, are particularly susceptible to emotional predators who use love bombing to make them feel special. Victims become attached to their abusers, perceiving rare positive behaviors in an amplified way. Abusers use intermittent reinforcement to create fear of losing the relationship, showing small kindnesses to manipulate their victims.",

        "Document": "Consumers screamed for it. Verizon answered. Later this month, the U.S. cellular carrier will offer shared data plans for entire families. Instead of each device on an account being allotted its own data limit, all devices in a family plan will draw from the same data pool. Verizon boasts that it listened to consumers and responded with an innovative service. But when it comes to the bottom line, is Verizon doing American families any favors? \n \n Our Family of Four \n \n ReadWriteWeb discussed the feasibility of shared data plans last year. Let\u2019s bring back our theoretical family of four and apply the shared data rates Verizon announced today. \n \n This theoretical upper-middle-class family has a mother, a father and two children. Both Ma and Pa have a smartphone and a tablet. The teenage kids each have a smartphone and share a tablet between them. The total is seven devices that under the old system would have required seven different data plans. \n \n Cost: $299.97 on the middle tier of Verizon\u2019s current family plan (AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile rates are slightly different): \n \n four lines with 700 talk minutes: $119.97 \n \n four smartphones with 2GB monthly data: $120 \n \n three tablets with 1GB monthly data: $60 \n \n Note: Cost estimates are before taxes and fees attached by the carriers and individual states. \n \n Focusing on the data aspect of the current family plan, that is 11GB of data for $180. Verizon points out that with the new shared plan, you pay a lot less for the data. The problem? You pay more per device. \n \n This is the pricing chart that Verizon announced today. \n \n Verizon's shared data plans are available on June 28. \n \n Let\u2019s run the numbers for our theoretical family. \n \n four smartphones with unlimited minutes: $160 \n \n three tablets: $30 \n \n 10GB monthly shared data plan: $100 \n \n In aggregate, the shared data plan comes in at $290, about $10 less than the current Verizon family plan. The family also loses 1GB of data. If we add it back as an overage charge (where the family exceeds its monthly allotment and is charged $10 for every additional GB), then the plans are exactly the same. \n \n Does this surprise anyone? Verizon's new plan does not give families a discount. The difference amounts to an administrative change in how Verizon gauges use within a family plan, not a change in how much it charges or the revenue it generates. \n \n Convenience and Choice \n \n Let\u2019s go back to our theoretical family. Last fall, we imagined that the father was a low-volume data user (to Dad, the smartphone is really just a phone) while the mother traveled a lot and was a high-volume user. Mom streams movies from Netflix, catches up on shows with Hulu Plus and listens to a lot of Pandora and talk radio with Stitcher. She just loves everything these mobile devices can do and hardly gives a thought to the amount of data she uses. The teenage kids take a lot of pictures, text and use social networks. They watch the occasional movie and a lot of YouTube. All in all, the kids are fairly normal smartphone users. \n \n Without a shared data plan, Dad\u2019s allotment of data pretty much goes to waste. Activities like checking and sending email on your phone take up very little data. The family is punished financially for Mom\u2019s freewheeling ways. So, if we break it down, the family on the shared data plan is actually being far more efficient with their allotment than each individual would be on their own. \n \n This has several benefits for both the consumer and the carrier. Individual consumers, on average, use about 2.2GB of data a month on their smartphones. Under many contracts, such as AT&T\u2019s 3GB for $30, they are paying for data they do not use. In the new Verizon system, those users would be punished for going over their 2GB allowance. \n \n For the carrier, the shared data plan represents a change in how consumers are measured. In the old family plan, a company like Verizon would measure average revenue per user (ARPU). In the shared data plan scenario, the measurement structure changes. The family, instead of being measured as a group of individuals, becomes a unit. When an individual uses more data in a given month, the ARPU for that person goes down. When taken as a unit, an individual\u2019s excess data use gets rolled into a lump sum without damaging (or theoretically, enhancing) Verizon\u2019s ARPU. \n \n Think of your family and ask yourself: What is easier? Is it better to collect family members under one lump-sum plan or keep them partitioned to their own personal data limits? That is really what it comes down to. Verizon is going to make the same amount of money either way. Let us know in the comments what approach your family is going to take. ||||| Individuals end up paying more as Verizon now forces unlimited voice and text messages -- even if they don't want them. \n \n (Credit: Jessica Dolcourt/CNET) \n \n Verizon Wireless' newly unveiled \"Share Everything\" plan may be a revolution in the industry, but it's going to leave a lot of individual customers unhappy with the change. \n \n \"Share Everything\" allows customers for the first time to share a common bucket of data, similar to what they do with voice minutes and text messages under a family plan. The benefit comes when large families sign up for a single plan, yielding some savings. \n \n I would be fine with the changes if \"Share Everything\" was just one of many options, but it's not. The new shared data plans, which includes a fee for unlimited voice and text, and a set amount of data, as well as another separate fee for each device, has become the new status quo. If you're a new customer, you'll have to choose one of these plans starting June 28. Fortunately for existing customers, they can keep their existing plans, although they will have to give up unlimited data if they choose to upgrade to a new subsidized phone. \n \n Some people may be okay with getting unlimited access to voice and text messages, but I'm not one of them. I suspect I'm not alone. At a time when people are using data services more, which power alternative text and calling apps, they are looking to lean on voice and text messages less. That's particularly the case as many folks move to the faster 4G LTE network, which consumes data even faster. \n \n But under the change, customers will have to give up their old grandfathered unlimited data plans right as people use more data than ever. It's a classic case of a carrier giving you more of what you don't need, and taking away what you do -- all for a higher price. \n \n The plans are clearly geared towards families -- particularly ones in which a few members don't use as much data -- at the expense of individuals. An individual with a plan that consists of 450 voice minutes, 1,000 text messages, and 2 gigabytes of data currently pays $80 a month. Under the new structure, which offers unlimited voice and text messages, the price is $100. \n \n As Verizon customer, I fall under the $80 plan, and rarely ever go over my calling or text message caps. I don't particularly relish the notion of a forced \"upgrade\" to a $100 plan -- $60 for 2GB of access and unlimited voice and text messages and a $40 access fee for a smartphone -- if I move to Share Everything. \n \n For a couple, the new share plan would cost $150 for access for two smartphones, 4GB of data, and unlimited text and voice. That's not much different than a current share plan that comes with 700 minutes, 1,000 text messages per phone, and 2GB of data each. Current couples, however, would have to give up their unlimited data plans in exchange for unlimited voice and text messages. \n \n Part of the problem are the high access fees for devices, which make it tough for individuals who want to sign up multiple devices under one plan. The access fee for a smartphones is $40 a month, while a basic phone is $30, and laptops, Netbooks, and mobile hotspots are $20. Even the lowest rate -- $10 a month for a tablet -- seems excessively high. \n \n Verizon Wireless Chief Marketing Officer Tami Erwin acknowledged that some people would end up paying more under the new system, but stressed the savings that families would be obtain under the new plan. \n \n It's easy to see why Verizon wants to focus on the family. Family plans of text messages and voice service aren't new, and have been tremendously successful at keeping groups of individuals tied to a single carrier. Verizon is hoping data will add another element of stickiness -- making it hard for family members to break away and sign up for their own plan at a different carrier. \n \n \"In a world where incentives for families favor concentrating around a single provider, the biggest providers win,\" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. \"In a household with two or three AT&T; or Verizon devices -- say, a smartphone and a tablet or two, and one device from T-Mobile or Sprint...Sprint doesn't stand a chance.\" \n \n The plans also open the door for AT&T; to offer an identical plan -- undoubtedly with a few slight tweaks to claim differentiation -- which is bad news for individuals on that carrier. \n \n The Verge's Chris Ziegler earlier today called the Verizon plans lackluster. I would go further and say it represents a raw deal for a lot of people. \n \n Corrected at 4:40 a.m. PT June 13: The story previously inaccurately suggested that a person upgrading a phone or changing a plan would be forced to move to a \"Share Everything\" plan. Current customers can actually keep their existing plan, although they would lose their unlimited data plan after an upgrade. ||||| Summary: I expected that carriers would not be giving anything away with shared data plans, but have to admit I am a bit disappointed that convenience comes at such a high price on Verizon. \n \n In May Verizon stated they were going to completely change their wireless plan structure and I am blown away by how fast this is now rolling out. Starting on 28 June, Verizon's new Share Everything plans are rolling out and will be the only option for customers, unless you stick with your existing plan and buy new phones at the unsubsidized pricing. The new plans give you more options, but this convenience comes at high price for individuals with minimum voice options. If you compare unlimited voice and text, then it is a good deal and for large families who all want data the plans are a great deal. \n \n The shared data plans are higher for individuals, but families who want multiple devices all with data will save quite a bit (if you want unlimited voice) with less worrying about per device data usage. A family of five will drop to $270 for five lines with a shared pool of 4GB, includes unlimited talk and text. Individuals who don't talk much on the phone, on the other hand, will see plan rates jump from the low of $69.99 (450 minutes and 2GB of data) to the lowest smartphone option of $90 for just 1GB of data. Granted these new shared plans come with unlimited voice and text messaging so if you make a lot of calls or send a lot of texts this may end up being a better option. I personally end up paying about 50 cents/minute for voice because I do not make that many calls on my mobile phone, but have to pay the minimum $40 per month. \n \n I would prefer to see wireless carriers offer compelling data only packages with per minute voice options. Like many people I see on my commute, data is used much more than voice on smartphones and voice seems to be where carriers make major profits. \n \n With these new shared plans you get unlimited voice and texts with data charged at these rates: \n \n 1 GB is $50 \n \n 2 GB is $60 \n \n 4 GB is $70 \n \n 6 GB is $80 \n \n 8 GB is $90 \n \n 10GB is $100 \n \n Monthly line access fees are as follows: \n \n $40 for a smartphone \n \n $30 for a basic feature phone \n \n $20 for USB stick, notebooks, netbooks \n \n $10 for tablets \n \n These plans also include WiFi hotspot functionality. I am not sure if things will change with the data only plans for the iPad and tablets. \n \n Given that I see excellent Verizon coverage and my daughters are getting older and heading off to college, I am considering a switch to Verizon where everyone can get data, unlimited texts, and unlimited voice minutes for a lower price than i pay even on low cost T-Mobile. \n \n If Sprint can get their LTE network up and running soon, they will look even more attractive for individual lines with their unlimited everything plans for $80 per smartphone. I am still grandfathered into unlimited data on Verizon at a total cost of $83, with taxes, and if I stick with Verizon I am going to just keep buying unsubsidized devices to take advantage of this data plan.",
        "Summary": "Verizon has introduced shared data plans that allow families to share a common data pool, which includes unlimited voice and text. While this benefits large families by potentially saving money, it forces individual customers to pay more and lose their unlimited data plans. The new pricing chart includes device fees ranging from $10 to $40 and data rates from 1GB to 10GB. Although the shared data plans are marketed as innovative, they do not offer significant discounts and primarily represent an administrative change in how Verizon gauges usage within a family plan.",

        "Document": "If you think young Americans are lazy, spend five minutes talking with Maria Rose Belding. \n \n The 20-year-old American University sophomore is the co-founder of MEANS Database, which connects people, organizations, and businesses with extra food with food banks and pantries that need it. In its first year, the food recovery notification system rescued about 4,000 pounds of food; became the first non-profit to win the GW New Venture Competition; and just took home a $10,000 prize from L\u2019Oreal Paris through its Women Of Worth campaign. (At the L\u2019Oreal Paris celebration event last week, Belding was the youngest of the 10 honorees.) It\u2019s also figuring out how to make enough money to become self sufficient, a rarity for non-profits. \n \n meansdatabase.com \n \n MEANS operates through both a website and an app, creating a simple system: A donor lists what\u2019s available, donees nearby get notifications, someone claims it and arranges for pick-up. As a high school freshman, Belding was volunteering at a local soup pantry in her hometown in Iowa, when she watched the director scramble to find recipients for the 10,000 boxes of macaroni and cheese a church had donated. Not everything found a home before the expiration date, and a lot ended up in the trash. \n \n In the world of food waste, this is the oft-cited paradox: There are 48 million Americans living in food insecurity, meaning that, at times during the year, these households were uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, enough food because they didn\u2019t have sufficient money or other resources. Yet Americans waste an estimated 40% of the country\u2019s food. It\u2019s not a problem of supply or demand. It\u2019s connecting the two. \n \n Hunger is a problem hitting more people than most realize, including college students. \u201cWe have several campus food pantries on MEANS,\u201d Belding tells Quartz. \u201cWe will be able to funnel food to the same kids we sit in class with.\u201d \n \n Belding\u2019s idea didn\u2019t become a reality, though, until she met her co-founder, Grant Nelson. He developed the technology while she found the donors, food banks, and pantries that would use the database. \n \n The technology and wide reach\u2014it currently has over 200 donor and recipient accounts representing more than 2,000 partner agencies and programs, spread out over 27 states\u2014are largely what makes MEANS different from other food rescue organizations. City Harvest, for example, provides a similar service in New York, rescuing a whopping 50 million pounds of food just this year. But it works at a larger scale and arranges the legwork itself, like matching and transporting donations with food kitchens that need them. The MEANS platform allows small organizations and individuals to participate on a scale that might be too small for an organization like City Harvest, but crucial to the people they help. Belding says nearly every donation finds a new home\u2014the only one she could remember that didn\u2019t was 23 individually wrapped cupcakes with a very short window of recovery time. \n \n Getty Images for L'Oreal Paris Belding strikes a pose at the L\u2019Oreal Paris Women of Worth 2015 Celebration in New York. \n \n Thanks in part to wins like the one from GW ($42,500 in cash and $20,000 in prizes) and L\u2019Oreal, MEANS now has a staff of 11 people, as well as 10 interns and volunteers. But, says Belding, \u201cI\u2019m not content to be chasing other people\u2019s money.\u201d So she and her team are working on a system to help them become less grant dependent. \n \n While large retail donors don\u2019t currently claim tax credits for their donation\u2014they\u2019re too small and localized to be worth the trouble\u2014MEANS already tracks all the information they would need. \u201dFor us, it\u2019s a matter of keystrokes,\u201d says Belding. \n \n Companies can use it to get tax benefits, while MEANS\u2014which is free for users\u2014takes a small fee. \u201dWe haven\u2019t started executing it yet, but every conversation with retailers we\u2019ve had has been, \u2018You can build that?'\u201d \n \n Next year, Belding hopes to launch that program, grow and improve the one already in place, and create a public, searchable directory of food pantries. (She\u2019s found that half the pantries she and her team have called list wrong numbers.) \n \n This week, though, Belding is focused on finals. On top of the full-time hours she puts into MEANS\u2014she didn\u2019t want to say how many because her parents will read the story\u2014she is still a student. And a very impressive one. Her report card this semester, she says, should be all As and A-minuses. \u201cThere might be a B-plus, but I\u2019m hoping not.\u201d ||||| Hear me out. \n \n I hated math in high school. In my 10th grade diary, I referred to geometry as 'a bunch of self-important shapes searching for nonexistent meaning.' (Sorry, Mr. Cutler.) At 16, I was full of sarcasm and empty of self-awareness, convinced learning trig was a waste of time and a distraction from the side project holding all my interest: trying to build a website for emergency food providers. Math felt like an exercise in frustration and wholly disconnected from trying to feed people struggling with hunger. \n \n I was wrong. \n \n I was trying to build a program that made it easier for emergency feeding systems like food pantries to communicate with each other and their donors. The idea, which I called MEANS (Matching Excess And Need for Stability), made sense in my head, but I couldn't get it to translate to a computer. That changed when I met Grant Nelson, a GWU law student who grew up 45 minutes from my Iowa hometown. A self-taught programmer, he looked at my idea and said, \"I think I can build that.\" He did. \n \n Grant became MEANS' co-founder and director of tech. He'd only been inside a food pantry once and I'd never seen real computer code. It was a huge learning curve for both of us, and one I couldn't have calculated the arc of if my life depended on it. As Grant introduced me to the concept of data science, it was clear I owed a few high school math teachers an apology. (Sorry, guys. I hope this makes up for some of the masterful eye rolls I sent your subject's way over the years.) \n \n I'm 20 now, and while my sarcasm supply is still aplenty, I've done a 180 on how I feel about math. (See what I did there?) There are now 11 young people, age 18 to 27, on Team MEANS, and we're working with hundreds of users representing thousands of programs and partnerships to reduce food waste and hunger at the same time. We're using a whole lot of math to do it, from tackling big data to determine the food pantries most likely to need and use MEANS to developing a public directory of emergency food resources around the country. It was because of meticulous record-keeping and data science that we discovered that as many as 50% of online listings for emergency food providers have incorrect contact information, and it is through coding and more data science that we're working to fix it. Math isn't the problem I thought it was - it's the solution. \n \n MEANS is an incredibly simple idea. Food pantries tell our system where they are, what they need and how far they're willing to travel to get it. The same platform allows pantries to notify their neighbor agencies when they're overwhelmed with a too-large donation, with traditional donors like grocery stores and restaurants able to use the same website to get food into the hands of the hungry. Our concept is simple and the execution extraordinarily complicated. Without math and its cooler cousin data science, we could have never brought MEANS to life. \n \n Math matters, for developing strategy, discovering the big picture and daring to think as differently as we have about hunger and food waste. Math can draw us a map of where to go next and numbers can lead us down paths we never considered before. There is too much need in this world to be focused solely on doing good - we have to also focus on doing that good well. Hunger is an enormous problem, and with 48 million Americans struggling to put food on the table, we need absolutely every tool we can find to build smart, sustainable solutions. MEANS lives in the space where empathy and entrepreneurship meet, and I'm so proud of a staff that never aims low and is always pushing for new goals. Charity can and should have a big brain to match its big heart. After all, if I remember correctly...with the right team, it's possible to build an equation where the limit does not exist. \n \n Maria Rose Belding is a (mostly) reformed high school math class nap-taker and co-founder/executive director of the MEANS Database. Now a college sophomore, Maria Rose is a nationally published writer on hunger and poverty, and the resources she developed for high schoolers tackling food insecurity are in the hands of more than a thousand students in schools in nine countries. She was recognized as a L'Or\u00e9al Paris Women of Worth in 2015 for making an extraordinary difference in her community. ||||| Maria Rose Belding and Grant Nelson founded a sprawling online network that connects thousands of food pantries in 24 states, allowing those organizations to quickly share surplus food that might have gone to waste otherwise. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) \n \n One of the most profound contradictions of modern America is that more than 45 million Americans don\u2019t have enough to eat, but the country wastes an estimated 40 percent of its food. The forces fueling this paradox are complex: Grocery stores think they\u2019ll assume legal liability in donating food. Farmers allow edible, but homely fruit to rot in fear it won\u2019t sell. Bananas blacken on all our shelves. \n \n But the reasons behind this waste didn\u2019t feel so complex to a teenage girl named Maria Rose Belding on a chilly Iowa day five years ago. \n \n The whole thing felt simple. It felt wrong. It felt like something had to change. \n \n Belding, then a volunteer at a local food pantry in Pella, had just thrown out hundreds of boxes of expired mac and cheese in front of numerous people lining up outside to collect food. \n \n \u201cWe were throwing away all of this food just because we couldn\u2019t communicate,\u201d Belding, then a freshman in high school, remembers venting that day. That frustration would ultimately lead the American University sophomore to develop a groundbreaking innovation in the long \u2014 and often inefficient \u2014 war on hunger. \n \n After years of research, Belding, 20, has founded a sprawling online network that connects thousands of food pantries in 24 states, allowing them to quickly share surplus food that might have otherwise gone to waste. Pantries simply post their excess food to the program \u2014 and someone else in the network picks it up and puts it to use. The database has saved an estimated two tons of food. \n \n L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris has since lauded the program, last week naming Belding one of its 10 women of worth. So has Arianna Huffington. And experts agree programs such as the interactive MEANS website, which stands for Matching Excess and Need for Stability, can close lapses in communication between pantries and chip away at the country\u2019s colossal problem with chronic waste. \n \n Food waste \u201cneeds to be addressed on multiple levels,\u201d said Mathy Stanislaus, a senior official with the Environmental Protection Agency who works on ending food waste. \u201cPart is wider knowledge of the problem, but also tools [like this] to reduce waste.\u201d \n \n The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Food production accounts for around 10 percent of the national energy budget, uses half of the country\u2019s land and consumes around 80 percent of all the freshwater used in the United States, according to a paper published in 2012 by the National Resources Defense Council. \n \n That means, the study noted, Americans squander $165 billion every year on food destined for landfills, where the decomposition of organic matter emits 16 percent of the country\u2019s methane \u2014 a greenhouse gas that\u2019s 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. \n \n Even people who donate to their local pantries are contributing, to some degree, to the problem. Emergency food centers have long been the last stop for whatever\u2019s lurking in the back of America\u2019s cupboards. And so, people donate an endless supply of near-expired creamed corn, beans and Honeybuns. The excess of product often does one of two things. It expires on the shelf and gets thrown out. Or it clutters the pantry so much that nonprofits can\u2019t accept premium donations that could immediately serve a community. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s very common for grocers to give poorly selling products in bulk to emergency food providers,\u201d Belding said. \u201cThat\u2019s just fine. But when you get 400 jars of peanut butter and you have two weeks to get rid of them and serve 100 people a month, total, and only distribute four times a month, that rapidly becomes a problem.\u201d \n \n When Belding started researching the concept behind the MEANS database while in high school, she was sure someone had beaten her to it. But she soon realized that the emergent technologies that had upended so many industries \u2014 tools to discern opportunity in unlikely places \u2014 hadn\u2019t yet found their way to the nation\u2019s nonprofit food pantries. Around half of the phone numbers listed under food pantries, she said, didn\u2019t even work. \n \n Belding thought she might be onto something. In her mind, there was clear need for a network. And so, at the beginning of her freshman year, she arrived at a friend\u2019s house and got to talking with his 24-year-old brother, Grant Nelson. Nelson, now a third-year law student at George Washington University and program co-founder, had experience with building programs. So she asked him if he could help. \n \n He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to. \u201cThis struck me as a changing-people\u2019s-behavior problem, rather than providing a tool to fulfill a need,\u201d he said. \u201cI said: \u2018Phones exist. Emails exist. Twitter exists. Facebook exists. What could we possibly build that would be slicker for all of the food banks and food pantries to communicate with each other that isn\u2019t already solved by something else?\u2019 \u201d \n \n In the end, he helped anyway. It took more than a year. A year of planning, researching and building program after program. Then in February, the website launched. \n \n Months passed. In May, Belding was sitting in class when she saw one of their nascent users had posted an item to the site. This was the moment, she realized, when the project would either succeed or fail. A sense of panic seized her when she saw someone was giving away assorted varieties of canned beans. \u201cThey\u2019re like the off-brand Mountain Dew in the food world,\u201d Belding said. \u201cYou\u2019ll take it only if you have no other option. . . . So we were all anxiously sitting by our computers hitting refresh, and I said, \u2018Please, someone take this.\u2019 And then, it\u2019s gone. It just disappeared. . . . The beans had moved.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe were kind of desperate,\u201d said Stephanie Shallah, an official with the District\u2019s So Others Might Eat who had posted the item. \u201cBeans come so often to me that I didn\u2019t think anyone would want them. So I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to just post it and see what happens.\u2019 I said, \u2018I have nothing to lose.\u2019 \u201d She said a Landover pantry serving a large Hispanic population took the goods. \n \n Things then happened very quickly for MEANS. The organization now commands a staff of several programmers paid through grant money and even a few interns who Belding concedes are older than she. The number of members on the site has grown from around 50 larger food banks in June to more than 200, opening up a network of thousands of smaller-shop pantries that work under the umbrella of those banks. \n \n But there\u2019s still a lot of work to do, Belding said. There are still 26 states that remain untapped. There\u2019s still the world. Belding said she had more calls to make. More connections to forge.",
        "Summary": "Maria Rose Belding, a 20-year-old American University sophomore, co-founded the MEANS Database, which connects people, organizations, and businesses with extra food to food banks and pantries in need. The platform, which operates in 27 states and has over 200 donor and recipient accounts, rescued 4,000 pounds of food in its first year. Belding's inspiration came from her experience volunteering at a local soup pantry in Iowa, where she saw food go to waste due to communication issues. Grant Nelson, a GWU law student, co-founded MEANS with Belding and developed the technology for the platform. MEANS has won several awards, including the GW New Venture Competition and a $10,000 prize from L\u2019Oreal Paris's Women Of Worth campaign. The organization aims to reduce food waste, which accounts for 40% of the country's food, while 48 million Americans live in food insecurity. MEANS differs from other food rescue organizations like City Harvest by allowing small organizations and individuals to participate. Belding and her team are working on making MEANS self-sufficient and less dependent on grants. Despite her busy schedule with MEANS, Belding is also focused on her studies, aiming for high grades in her finals.",

The company is reviewing taking legal action against both KTVU-TV and the NTSB.\" \n \n \n \n Update: The NTSB has released a statement stating an intern is responsible for confirming the incorrect names. Sounds like someone's summer internship is over. \n \n KTVU has also provided further explanation into why they said these names on air: They didn't say them out loud before rattling them off during their live taping and they didn't confirm with the NTSB employee (intern) on their position within the organization. They did, however, call to verify the correct spelling of the names. \n \n \n \n Update: Peter Knudson, a spokesman for the NTSB, just confirmed to SF Weekly that the NTSB did not release the names of the pilots of flight 214 to KTVU, or any news organization, for that matter. \n \n \n \n Original Story: Local station KTVU totally screwed up the names of Asiana Flight 214 pilots when announcing them on live television today, and we're a little worried the name \"Ho Lee Fuk\" might actually go down in history. \n \n So just to correct the record: The ill-fated Boeing 777 wasn't actually being steered by Mr. Fuk and his co-pilots Sum Ting Wong, Wi Tu Lo, and Bang Ding Ow. \n \n KTVU rushed to fix the blunder and issued an apology,blaming the NTSB for the fuck-up. The apology didn't do much to stop screenshots of the offensive names from making their rounds through the blogosphere. \n \n Oh, look -- here they are: \n \n And here's a video of the newscaster announcing the names with complete sincerity -- with \"Fuk\" pronounced \"Fook,\" lest you suspect the station of impropriety: \n \n Note: Asiana actually released the names of two pilots -- the ones allegedly responsible for the botched landing -- on Sunday. Junior pilot Lee Gang-guk had 43 hours of experience flying the Boeing jet; his supervisor Lee Jeong-min tried to take over to abort the crash. \n \n Someone call Ron Burgundy, this is a story for him. ||||| On today\u2019s Noon newscast on KTVU, the station claimed it had \u201cjust learned the names of the 4 pilots on board\u201d Asiana flight 214 which crashed last Saturday. But the station was given bad information that made it all the way into the newscast. If you read the names it becomes immediately clear this is a joke, which went unnoticed by the newsroom, producers and the anchor. \n \n You\u2019ll recall earlier this week, KTVU touted its coverage as being not only first, but \u201c100% accurate.\u201d \n \n \u201cBeing first on air and on every platform in all aspects of our coverage was a great accomplishment, but being 100% accurate, effectively using our great sources and social media without putting a single piece of erroneous information on our air, is what we are most proud of as a newsroom,\u201d said News Director Lee Rosenthal at the time. Watch: \n \n About 15 minutes later the station corrected its mistake, but claimed an NTSB official had confirmed the names. \n \n Earlier in the newscast we gave some names of pilots involved in the Asiana Airlines crash. These names were not accurate despite an NTSB official in Washington confirming them late this morning. We apologize for this error. \n \n > More: Further apology from KTVU president & GM Tom Raponi: \u201cWe sincerely regret the error and took immediate action to apologize, both in the newscast where the mistake occurred, as well as on our website and social media sites. Nothing is more important to us than having the highest level of accuracy and integrity, and we are reviewing our procedures to ensure this type of error does not happen again.\u201d \n \n >More: The NTSB has released a statement saying a summer intern \u201cacted outside the scope of his authority\u201d and mistakenly confirmed the fake names for KTVU Friday morning: \n \n The National Transportation Safety Board apologizes for inaccurate and offensive names that were mistakenly confirmed as those of the pilots of Asiana flight 214, which crashed at San Francisco International Airport on July 6.

I will be contacting the FBI and the Justice Department,\u201d Scaramucci wrote, inexplicably tagging White House Chief of Staff Reince Priebus. Scaramucci did not specify what information was leaked, but a Politico article cited the incoming communications director\u2019s required financial disclosure in reporting he earned $4.9 million since last year from his ownership stake in investment firm SkyBridge. Scaramucci appeared to delete the tweet, but in a subsequent post said Priebus was among the senior White House officials helping to crack down on leaks. ||||| The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge. | Pablo Martinez Monsivais/AP Scaramucci still stands to profit from SkyBridge from the White House The newly named White House communications director has earned millions from ownership stake since last year, according to his financial disclosure. \n \n Anthony Scaramucci finally has his White House job, but he still stands to profit from an ownership stake in his investment firm SkyBridge Capital. \n \n The incoming White House communications director earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in SkyBridge in addition to more than $5 million in salary between Jan. 1, 2016, and the end of June, when he joined the Export-Import Bank, according to a financial disclosure filed with the Office of Government Ethics. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The disclosure form, which is publicly available upon request, hasn\u2019t been previously reported. \n \n The disclosure highlights the extensive wealth Scaramucci has accumulated in his career \u2014 much like many of Trump\u2019s other top advisers and Cabinet secretaries \u2014 and also the challenge he faces in extracting himself from the potential conflicts his investments could pose. \n \n Scaramucci\u2019s financial filing values SkyBridge Capital at more than $50 million and states that he owns nearly 44 percent of the firm. When the sale of the company is completed, expected to be in the third quarter of this year, he will receive \u201cthe agreed-upon purchase price for his share of the sale proceeds,\u201d according to the filing. \n \n Bloomberg valued the Skybridge deal at between $200 million and $230 million when it was announced in January. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s black and white that he\u2019s going to get money,\u201d said Austin Evers, executive director at American Oversight, a watchdog group that focuses on transparency in government. \n \n The SkyBridge website continues to advertise Scaramucci as the firm's managing director, despite the fact that he has been a government employee for more than a month. A SkyBridge spokeswoman said Scaramucci stepped down from the executive post Jan. 17, when the company\u2019s sale was announced. He remained an employee of the firm, collecting a salary, until starting at Ex-Im last month. \n \n The investment firm, which Scaramucci founded in 2005, is in the process of being sold to RON Transatlantic and Chinese conglomerate HNA Group. The sale, set in motion in January when Scaramucci was shedding his holdings in anticipation of landing an administration job, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and is taking longer than expected to close. \n \n The interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is examining the deal to ensure that it carries no risk to national security. The panel\u2019s review, which comes amid ramped-up scrutiny of business dealings with China, ultimately can be overruled by President Donald Trump. \n \n Scaramucci said Friday his start date wouldn\u2019t be until August so that everything can be \u201c100 percent totally cleansed and clean and I don\u2019t see an issue with it.\u201d \n \n White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom referred questions about Scaramucci\u2019s SkyBridge investment to the Treasury. Treasury spokeswoman Marisol Garibay did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Scaramucci, a Trump fundraiser and frequent campaign surrogate whose appointment to an administration post was delayed in part because of the complicated nature of the SkyBridge sale, joined Ex-Im in June. \n \n Ex-Im was seen as a \"very temporary move,\" a way to get the Trump loyalist to Washington until a higher-level position could be found, according to one White House adviser. \n \n The bank is across the street from the White House, where Scaramucci was free to come and go thanks to security credentials that gave him 24-hour access. That allowed him to elude the detection of senior White House staffers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. \n \n Scaramucci has been on unpaid leave from Ex-Im since the day he started there, June 19, a bank spokeswoman said, forgoing his $172,100 salary as chief strategy officer. \n \n A friend said Scaramucci thought his stay at the bank would be longer-lived and that the White House job came unexpectedly. \n \n In his disclosure, Scaramucci listed assets worth as much as $85 million. He has several real estate investments, including single-family rental homes on Long Island. \n \n A minority stake in the New York Mets is worth as much as $5 million. He also is an investor in Juice Press, a chain of snack and smoothie shops in the Northeast. \n \n Scaramucci earned $200,000 in income from a majority stake in Hastings Capital Group, according to his financial disclosure. That ownership share also will be sold as part of the SkyBridge deal with RON and HNA. \n \n As a contributor to Fox News, Scaramucci earned about $88,000, according to his financial disclosure. \n \n He has three mortgages with U.S. Bank for a total liability of $2.5 million to $7 million. \n \n Josh Dawsey contributed to this report. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

        "Document": "Something far more concerning than marching bands, balloons, cheerleaders and clowns was at the Macy's Thanksgiving Day Parade . Confidential personal information is what some paradegoers found among confetti tossed during the world's most famous parade. That information included social security numbers and banking information for police employees, some of whom are undercover officers.Ethan Finkelstein, who was home from college on Thanksgiving break, was watching the parade at 65th Street and Central Park West, when he and a friend noticed a strip of confetti stuck onto her coat.\"It landed on her shoulder,\" Finkelstein told PIX11 News, \"and it says 'SSN' and it's written like a social security number, and we're like, 'That's really bizarre.'It made the Tufts University freshman concerned, so he and his friends picked up more of the confetti that had fallen around them.\"There are phone numbers, addresses, more social security numbers, license plate numbers and then we find all these incident reports from police.\"One confetti strip indicates that it's from an arrest record, and other strips offer more detail. \"This is really shocking,\" Finkelstein said. \"It says, 'At 4:30 A.M. a pipe bomb was thrown at a house in the Kings Grant' area.\"A closer look shows that the documents are from the Nassau County Police Department. The papers were shredded, but clearly not well enough.They even contain information about Mitt Romney 's motorcade, apparently from the final presidential debate, which took place at Hofstra University in Nassau County last month.Most significant, the confetti strips identified Nassau County detectives by name. Some of them are apparently undercover. Their social security numbers, dates of birth and other highly sensitive personal information was also printed on the confetti strips.\"I'm just completely in shock,\" said Finkelstein, 18. \"How could someone have this kind of information, and how could it be distributed at the Thanksgiving Day Parade?\"It's a question that PIX11 wanted an answer to as well. The Nassau County Police Department told PIX11, via a written statement from its commanding officer for public information, Inspector Kenneth Lack, \"The Nassau County Police Department is very concerned about this situation. We will be conducting an investigation into this matter as well as reviewing our procedures for the disposing of sensitive documents.\"For its part, the sponsor of the parade, Macy's, told PIX11 News that it uses \"commercially manufactured, multicolor confetti, not shredded paper.\"It appears that the confetti strips are shredded police documents. Where they came from is still a mystery, but the people looking into the issue are trained at solving mysteries , and since they have a personal stake in the investigation, it may be more likely to be conclusive. ||||| Federal prosecutors told a judge last week that they have started reassembling documents shredded by the Stanford Financial Group, whose owner, R. Allen Stanford, is charged with running a $7 billion Ponzi scheme. How do you reconstruct documents after they've been passed through a shredder? \n \n With a computer. In a typical reconstruction process, technicians feed all the available shreds into a scanner. An automated software program then assigns a unique ID to each piece and analyzes a number of characteristics, including size, color, indentation, and font. Using a matching algorithm, the software then identifies potential neighboring shreds, displaying them onscreen for an operator to confirm. (For the home user, an Israeli company sells software that can turn any PC and scanner into an \"unshredder.\") \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Not all shredded documents can be put back together. The possibility and ease of reconstruction depends on the size of the shreds\u2014the smaller and more numerous the pieces, the harder it is to reconstruct a document. Strip shredders cut paper into long strips 1/8- to 5/16-inch wide and are the most popular option because of their speed and low cost\u2014but they're also the easiest to reassemble since they produce a relatively small number of large fragments. Cross-cut shredders, which slice paper into many tiny, confettilike pieces, are significantly more secure (and expensive), while shredders that pulverize paper into dust cost thousands of dollars but are essentially reconstruction-proof. (To secure top-secret information, the Department of Defense requires that the majority of shredded particles \"not exceed 5 square millimeters.\") When using a strip-shredder, the slicing direction also has implications for reconstruction. Horizontal cuts may leave entire lines of text intact. Vertical shredding, which ensures that sentences are broken up, is more secure. \n \n Before advances in scanning and computer technology, documents had to be reconstructed by hand. Assuming all the pieces are in one place, reassembling a shredded document is a bit like solving a jigsaw puzzle; the reconstructionist must painstakingly sift through the shreds, looking for matches. During the 1979 Iranian Revolution, students and militants who took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran turned to local carpet weavers to reassemble classified CIA documents they found that had been shredded. These pages were later published in a set of about 60 volumes called Documents From the U.S. Espionage Den. And in 2002, former FBI agent William Daly took about an hour to reassemble a shredded page from the dictionary on Good Morning America. \n \n Got a question about today's news? Ask the Explainer.",

        "Document": "Steve Jobs' resignation as Apple Inc.'s CEO might seem like a step out of the spotlight at the world's largest company. But it is possible that little may change with the executive shuffle at Apple. \n \n As CEO, Jobs' bosses -- who he had to answer to -- were technically Apple's board of directors and shareholders. Jobs was also a member of the Apple board, but recently Apple had not listed anyone as Apple's official chairman. Instead, Apple listed two co-lead directors of the board; Andrea Jung, chairwoman and CEO of Avon Products Inc., and Arthur D. Levinson, chairman and CEO of Genentech Inc. Now Jobs is the chairman of the board. \n \n Photos: Steve Jobs and Apple's influence \n \n Jobs hasn't been running Apple's day to day operations since January, when he handed over those responsibilities to Tim Cook, the company's former chief operating officer who has been voted in as CEO by Apple's board. \n \n Despite being on a leave of absence for medical reasons, the details of which have remained private, Jobs has remained involved in some of Apple's biggest decisions this year. For example, it was Jobs who unveiled the iPad 2 in March, not Cook. \n \n As for who will announce and show off the iPhone 5 or iPad 3, Cook or Jobs, that remains to be seen. \n \n In being promoted from COO to CEO, Tim Cook has also been given a seat on Apple's board, just as Jobs had. \n \n The addition of Tim Cook to the board ups the number of directors from seven to eight. All other directors remain. \n \n Besides Jung and Levinson, the other directors are William V. Campbell, chairman of Intuit Inc.; Millard S. Drexler, chairman and CEO of J. Crew; former Vice President Al Gore; and Ronald D. Sugar, former chairman and CEO or Northrop Grumman Corp. \n \n RELATED: \n \n Steve Jobs resigns as Apple's CEO \n \n Apple publishes Steve Jobs' resignation letter \n \n Tim Cook era begins as Steve Jobs resigns as Apple CEO \n \n -- Nathan Olivarez-Giles and Thomas Suh Lauder \n \n twitter.com/nateog \n \n Photo (top): Apple's then-CEO and current chairman, Steve Jobs, holds the iPhone 4 during the Apple Worldwide Developers Conference last year in San Francisco.

Credit: Apple Inc. ||||| The only thing surprising about Steve Jobs's resignation\u2014which Apple had telegraphed several times already\u2014was the timing. Why now? Because of health concerns, maybe. Or maybe because now, right now, is the perfect time for the company to transition. \n \n When I say now, I'm not talking about the dusky timing of the press release; the cardinal rule of bad news is that you bury it as late as you can. I mean now in the broader context of Apple's future. And if the company's going to not just survive but thrive without Jobs, he couldn't have left any sooner. And he definitely couldn't have waited. \n \n Apple has literally never been stronger. A month ago they reported record quarterly earnings in a period with no significant product releases, no back to school or holiday boost, all amid what turned out to be a grotesquely challenging three months for competitors like Dell and HP. They were, for a brief period, the most valuable company in the world. Incredible. \n \n And a month from now? They'll be releasing their next iPhone on America's three major carriers. And very possibly something altogether new: an affordable iPhone, a handset for the masses. If that device does emerge, Apple will have transitioned from yuppie luxury to unprecedented populist value. \n \n So that's where Apple sits now, cratered between two mountainous achievements. If they'd waited any longer, the iPhone 5 announcement would've been fully shrouded in memories of Jobs; with a month's distance, new CEO Tim Cook has a chance to stand on his own. He can bask in the reflected glory of the iPhone instead of languishing in Jobs's shadow. The company will feel like it's in good hands. Because it is. \n \n What's easy to forget is that companies have long, long product cycles. The iPhone 5's been done for months; ditto, likely, iPad 3. And iPhone 6 plans are well underway. They'll all have a touch of Jobs in them. Even products with a longer horizon, future generations of MacBooks with sick-skinny bodies and flash storage and no optical disc, AppleTVs teeming with apps, will have Jobs's imprimatur. Especially since, uh, guys? He's staying on as Chairman of the Board. He's involved. \n \n So yes, there is a chance that Steve Jobs is resigning now because his medical situation has become so severe that he has no other choice. But we certainly hope not. And sincerely don't think so. Because this feels calculated, in the best possible way, to happen at the best possible time. Now. \n \n You can keep up with Brian Barrett, the author of this post, on Twitter, Facebook, or Google+. ||||| ANALYSIS \n \n He may still be chairman of the board, but in the eyes of the world Steve Jobs has ceased to be the heart of Apple. \n \n The succession plan, one of the most closely guarded secrets this side of D-Day, is running. As it has been running for at least two years; the date of Jobs's departure may not have been known, but that it was approaching most certainly was. \n \n These past couple of years have been the strongest test yet of Jobs's famous reality distortion field, his ability to convince everyone he works with that what he says is either true or can \u2014 must \u2014 be made so. But some realities are not to be denied. \n \n Apple without Jobs is now one of them. Like any empire without its Caesar, what the next Apple will be, what it does and how it does it, depends on which of the factions within gains control. \n \n Many Apples \n \n For there are many Apples. One is that of new chief executive Tim Cook, who is as much responsible for Apple's success as Jobs was. He turned the business of actually making the goods into an imperial machine, controlling suppliers and manufacturers with unmatched ruthlessness. Making close to 100-percent margins on consumer electronics in an austere, hyper-competitive market is as miraculous as anything ever demonstrated in a keynote. \n \n Then there's the Apple normal people know and write about, a company capable of producing an endless stream of new products with pitch-perfect cadence. It is a marketing powerhouse \u2014 for how else do you account for Apple's coronation as king of all things technology, when all it makes is a mobile phone now on its fourth incarnation, a mutant mobile phone too big to put in a pocket, and a few laptops? Put that way \u2014 a valid analysis that seems heretical \u2014 Apple's success is even more miraculous, more reality defying, than if it had been more like Sony with its huge range of products. \n \n And there's the innovatory Apple, which lives well beneath the radar. With the exception of the ghostly presence of Jonathan Ive, this is an invisible and unknown force. The products and services appear, companies are swallowed up, and the star players leave. The big decisions are no longer what chip to use, what new hardware features are too cool not to have, but what deals can be done with media companies, what marketing advantage can be gained by rounding up which supplier. \n \n Success through control \n \n The signs are strong that Tim Cook's Viking armies will prevail, and without a struggle. It's where the money comes from, and where any attack is to be resisted by any means necessary. Apple of late has become self-righteously litigious, a terrible temptation for any company with fewer ideas and far more money than once it had, but nearly irresistible for one that's learned that success comes through control. If you can't out-think the competition, then it can be controlled through lawsuits \u2014 and if you lose a few, it doesn't matter. The damage has been done. And Apple of late has been run by Cook. \n \n Apple of late has become self-righteously litigious, a terrible temptation for any company with fewer ideas and far more money than once it had. \n \n Looking beyond the iPhone and the iPad, both of which can only be refreshed so far, there is only uncertainty. Apple in the cloud is Apple unproven. Apple as innovator without Jobs is Apple unknown. Apple in a market where everyone else can do what it does, but can do it cheaper, is unApple. \n \n Apple will play to what strengths it has, and that looks like a marketing-led, litigiously-active, cash-rich giant determined to protect what it has over building out what comes next. \n \n For with Jobs, there was always a 'next', even if we didn't know what it was going to be. As one part of the company's history was maturing, Steve Jobs would always be there on stage, unveiling just one more thing: the Mac, the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad. \n \n That won't happen again. Apple's future depends on the new next, and the longer we have to wait to see what happens, the less likely it will happen at all. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Allegations had also surfaced that Trump had asked Comey to scale back the probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Mueller was granted the authority to prosecute any federal crimes he uncovered. \n \n Mueller served in the Vietnam War as a Marine, receiving a Purple Heart. Following a career in both the public and private sectors, including several years as a federal prosecutor, Mueller served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013. He gave up his position with the law firm WilmerHale to take the special counsel appointment. \n \n In its first year, the Mueller investigation has remained tight-lipped about its activities, except when it comes to indictments and plea deals. The investigation has obtained five guilty pleas, plus indictments numbering in the double digits. The team has done this while coming under attack by Trump and his allies, who allege partisan bias and decry it as a \"disgusting, illegal and unwarranted witch hunt.\" \n \n Meanwhile, the investigation\u2019s endgame could involve complicated legal decisions about whether presidents can be subpoenaed or indicted, and whether Trump can fire Mueller or use pardons to stymie the probe. \n \n Who\u2019s on Mueller\u2019s team? \n \n The Special Counsel\u2019s office had made public the identities of 17 attorney staff members, spurring Trump to criticize the investigators are largely \"hardened Democrats.\" \n \n Through public records, we were able to independently confirm that at least 12 people on Mueller\u2019s staff are registered Democrats. Two others are registered to vote but have not chosen a party affiliation. We were unable to independently confirm the status of two other staff members. \n \n Mueller, though, is registered as a Republican in the District of Columbia and was appointed to offices by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as by Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. \n \n In addition, Mueller was appointed by Rosenstein, who was nominated for deputy attorney general by Trump himself, and who previously was appointed as a U.S. Attorney by George W. Bush (and later kept on by Obama). \n \n It\u2019s worth noting that other FBI or Justice Department personnel are assisting the investigation in certain capacities, but the names of investigative and office support personnel have not been made public. \n \n Mueller was prevented from considering political affiliation when putting together his team by both Justice Department policy and the Civil Service Reform Act. Moreover, the career attorneys on the Mueller team are bound by professional codes to pursue justice and rise above partisanship. \n \n What has the investigation produced so far? \n \n Within a month of his appointment, Mueller began looking into the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. \n \n On Oct. 30, 2017, Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates \u2014 two former senior officials with the Trump campaign \u2014 were indicted on 12 counts related to their political consulting business, including money laundering. Also on that day, George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide, pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI. \n \n On Dec. 1, 2017, Flynn pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI about conversations he\u2019d had with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \n \n On Feb. 16, 2018, Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities on charges related to the 2016 election. \n \n Days later, Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan pled guilty for lying to the FBI about his dealings with Gates and another unnamed person. He was later sentenced to 30 days in prison. \n \n On Feb. 22, Mueller upped the ante against Manafort and Gates with 32 new financial charges. Within days, Gates pled guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Manafort, however, has continued to fight his charges. \n \n Beyond these official acts, the Mueller investigation has publicly announced little about what it is doing, and leaks from its own ranks have been scarce to nonexistent. So its activities remain largely hidden. \n \n Can Mueller subpoena Trump? \n \n Most legal experts told PolitiFact that being president doesn\u2019t offer blanket protection against a subpoena, as Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has claimed. But there are enough gaps in the legal precedent that Trump\u2019s team could raise legal challenges that the courts would have to take seriously. \n \n In a case involving President Bill Clinton, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a civil suit could go forward against a sitting president, rather than having to wait until their term was over. Given that the court green-lighted a presidential interview in a civil suit such as this one, it might be even more likely to do so in a criminal investigation, experts said. But the reality is that no one knows how the high court would rule in a criminal case related to Mueller\u2019s investigation. \n \n Meanwhile, in the Watergate-related case United States vs. Nixon, special prosecutor Leon Jaworski wanted tapes of President Richard Nixon talking to his aides. Nixon, citing executive privilege, refused to hand them over. But the high court unanimously sided with the prosecution. \n \n This decision suggests that presidents are not exempt from subpoenas in a criminal investigation. That said, it may depend on the nature of the subpoena. The court today could decide that a subpoena for in-person questioning -- rather than documents or tapes -- could be overly broad, or that some potential subpoena requests fall too far outside the scope of Mueller\u2019s investigation. \n \n Can Mueller indict Trump? \n \n Officially, there has never been a binding judicial opinion on this question. \n \n \"It is unresolved,\" said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California-Irvine. \"The Watergate grand jury in 1974 named Richard Nixon an \u2018unindicted co-conspirator\u2019 because they did not know if they could indict a sitting president.\" \n \n That said, there is a widespread assumption among legal experts that courts would rule against the idea of prosecuting a sitting president. \n \n This is primarily due to a pair of opinions by the Office of Legal Counsel, the closely watched office within the Justice Department that advises presidential administrations on the legality of taking certain positions or actions. \n \n The office looked at this question in 1973 and 2000, concluded on both occasions that a president could not be criminally prosecuted. Criminal prosecution, the office determined, would undermine the executive branch\u2019s ability to perform its functions. Ultimately, \"only the House of Representatives has the authority to bring charges of criminal misconduct through the constitutionally sanctioned process of impeachment,\" the office wrote in 2000. \n \n Can Trump fire Mueller? \n \n Over the course of the year, Trump has mulled, privately and publicly, whether he should remove Mueller. \n \n Mueller\u2019s potential removal falls into a legal gray area that involves Justice Department regulations, congressional statutes and constitutional law. \n \n Under Justice Department regulations, only the attorney general can fire Mueller. In this instance, Rosenstein, who\u2019s acting as attorney general in place of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for this purpose, would have that authority. (Sessions recused himself from the investigation.) \n \n The regulations also state that in order to fire Mueller, there has to be a good reason \u2014 specifically \"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of departmental policies.\" \n \n Under this scenario, Trump could order Rosenstein to fire Mueller, but Rosenstein could refuse if he believed that there had been no misconduct by Mueller. \n \n Alternately, the president could fire Rosenstein, and then continue firing Justice Department brass until someone was willing to fire Mueller. But the official who ultimately carried it out could face enormous public blowback. \n \n A third possibility is that Trump could seek to rescind the Justice Department regulations. However, this would require a lengthy process that would allow Mueller to continue operating in the meantime. \n \n What if a court decided that Mueller\u2019s appointment \u2014 and firing \u2014 was governed by congressional statute rather than the Justice Department rules? That would allow Trump to fire Mueller directly, since the congressional statute contains no requirement for misconduct before a firing. \n \n However a firing was carried out, Mueller would have standing to challenge it in court. \n \n A more promising course for Trump than firing Mueller might be convincing Sessions to narrow the scope of his recusal. If Sessions agreed to do that, he could curb the scope of Muller\u2019s probe. \n \n Could Trump use pardons to get around Mueller? \n \n As early as July 2017, news reports suggested that the White House and its legal advisers were weighing whether and how to use the president\u2019s power. \n \n Can the president pardon himself? Even legal experts who are skeptical acknowledge that no one knows for sure. \n \n The Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly prohibit a self-pardon, except in the case of impeachment. However, experts said there are several more circumstantial arguments that, collectively, make a strong case that a self-pardon would be impermissible. \n \n The Constitution uses the word \"grant,\" which ordinarily means giving to someone else, said Harold H. Bruff, an emeritus University of Colorado law professor. Going back to its English monarchical origins, a pardon has long been conceived as an act of mercy. Neither of these suggest something that can be done to oneself. \n \n In addition, Bruff said that when the Constitution was being written, \"a background value everywhere in the air was that no one should be a judge in their own cause.\" This notion, sometimes referred to in Latin as \"nemo judex in causa sua,\" is a longstanding common-law principle, he said. \n \n It\u2019s worth noting a downside of a president pardoning themself: It\u2019s a tacit acknowledgement that they had committed a crime, which could supercharge impeachment efforts. \n \n Pardoning presidential associates could be more effective, but that would not be a cure-all for Trump, either. \n \n \"A pardon would not end an investigation into any one person as the investigation is about the Russian interference with the election,\" Robenalt said. \"The fact that someone may be pardoned or dead matters not to an investigator who is trying to connect dots.\" \n \n To truly shut down the probe using pardon power, a president would either have to separately pardon a multitude of individuals by name \u2014 a rolling game of \"Whac-a-Mole,\" as Bruff put it \u2014 or else issue a blanket amnesty. While such blanket amnesties have been implemented before, none have been enacted to protect a presidency. \n \n CORRECTION, May 17, 2018, 12:00 noon: This version corrects the number of guilty pleas obtained by Mueller. It is five, not four.",
        "Summary": "Robert Mueller was appointed as special counsel by Rod Rosenstein to investigate links between the Russian government and individuals associated with President Donald Trump's campaign. Mueller, a former FBI director and Vietnam War veteran, has faced criticism from Trump and his allies, who allege partisan bias. The investigation has led to multiple indictments and guilty pleas, including those of Paul Manafort, Rick Gates, Michael Flynn, George Papadopoulos, and Alex van der Zwaan. The investigation's scope includes potential obstruction of justice by Trump, who fired FBI Director James Comey and allegedly asked him to scale back the probe into Flynn. Legal experts debate whether a sitting president can be subpoenaed or indicted, with historical cases like United States vs. Nixon suggesting that presidents are not exempt from subpoenas in criminal investigations. The Office of Legal Counsel has previously concluded that a president cannot be criminally prosecuted. Trump has considered firing Mueller and using pardons to stymie the investigation, but these actions could face significant legal and public challenges.",

It has been under French control since the 1700s. \n \n The island has been plagued by terrorism -- including bombings, robberies, and assaults -- since 1976, with the FLNC in the throes of a long, low-intensity military campaign against French targets on the island. \n \n In 1997, several banks and government offices were targeted in more than 50 bomb explosions in one day, for which FLNC claimed responsibility. \n \n France's government launched a ferocious crackdown in Corsica after a top French official there was gunned down in 1998 on the street of Ajaccio. This spurred a series of nationalist protests, followed by a string of FLNC attacks against French targets. \n \n A branch of the separatist group announced in 2003 that it would suspend its military actions. But attacks by FLNC continued, although with less frequency. ||||| Corsica\u2019s largest armed independence group has said it will lay down its weapons in favour of conventional political channels to further its ambitions on the French Mediterranean island. \n \n The unexpected decision by the National Liberation Front of Corsica signals an end to almost 40 years of armed struggle for Corsican independence that began with a series of attacks in May 1976. \n \n It also comes just a few months after Eta, the militant Basque separatist organisation, revealed in February that it had agreed to decommission some of its cache of weapons and explosives, taking a further step towards drawing a line under decades of bloody conflict in Spain. \n \n In a communiqu\u00e9 issued on Wednesday evening, the FLNC said: \u201cWithout prior notification and without ambiguity, our organisation has unilaterally decided to start a demilitarisation process and a progressive exit from clandestine activities.\u201d \n \n It added: \u201cThe time has come for our organisation to intensify the fight in the public arena.\u201d \n \n Gilles Millet, a journalist at Corsica, a monthly publication that has had contact with the armed group in the past, said that the 14-page communiqu\u00e9 was authentic. \n \n The group, which Mr Millet said comprised more than 100 members and whose independence cause still enjoys support among many of the island\u2019s 320,000 residents, said that part of the reason for disarmament was several recent advances via conventional means. \n \n In April, the local assembly approved a bill limiting land and property purchases to those who have been a Corsican resident for at least five years. The idea was to put an end to a wave of speculation-driven inflation in real estate prices on the island in recent years. \n \n An estimated 40 per cent of properties on the island are second homes owned by non-residents. Now a popular tourist destination, Corsica was conquered by the French in the 18th century. Ajaccio, the capital, was the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte. \n \n The FLNC said on Wednesday that measures such as the property-owning restrictions \u201con subjects prohibited for so many years, trace the outlines of a political solution . . . we are moving from a phase of combat and resistance to a phase of the construction of a true Corsican political power\u201d. \n \n Thousands of attacks have been carried out in Corsica and the French mainland since the separatist movement was founded, with the FLNC claiming responsibility in many cases. \n \n The attacks have included the murder of policemen, the bombing of banks in Paris and rocket attacks on government buildings.",

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. \n \n Beloit, Wis. \u2013 Born when Ross Perot was warning about a giant sucking sound and Bill Clinton was apologizing for pain in his marriage, members of this fall\u2019s entering college class of 2014 have emerged as a post-email generation for whom the digital world is routine and technology is just too slow. \n \n Each August since 1998, Beloit College has released the Beloit College Mindset List. It provides a look at the cultural touchstones that shape the lives of students entering college this fall. The creation of Beloit\u2019s Keefer Professor of the Humanities Tom McBride and former Public Affairs Director Ron Nief, it was originally created as a reminder to faculty to be aware of dated references, and quickly became a catalog of the rapidly changing worldview of each new generation. The Mindset List website at www.beloit.edu/mindset, the Mediasite webcast and its Facebook page receive more than 400,000 hits annually. \n \n The class of 2014 has never found Korean-made cars unusual on the Interstate and five hundred cable channels, of which they will watch a handful, have always been the norm. Since \"digital\" has always been in the cultural DNA, they've never written in cursive and with cell phones to tell them the time, there is no need for a wrist watch. Dirty Harry (who\u2019s that?) is to them a great Hollywood director. The America they have inherited is one of soaring American trade and budget deficits; Russia has presumably never aimed nukes at the United States and China has always posed an economic threat. \n \n Nonetheless, they plan to enjoy college. The males among them are likely to be a minority. They will be armed with iPhones and BlackBerries, on which making a phone call will be only one of many, many functions they will perform. They will now be awash with a computerized technology that will not distinguish information and knowledge. So it will be up to their professors to help them. A generation accustomed to instant access will need to acquire the patience of scholarship. They will discover how to research information in books and journals and not just on-line. Their professors, who might be tempted to think that they are hip enough and therefore ready and relevant to teach the new generation, might remember that Kurt Cobain is now on the classic oldies station. The college class of 2014 reminds us, once again, that a generation comes and goes in the blink of our eyes, which are, like the rest of us, getting older and older. \n \n Most students entering college for the first time this fall\u2014the Class of 2014\u2014were born in 1992. \n \n For these students, Benny Hill, Sam Kinison, Sam Walton, Bert Parks and Tony Perkins have always been dead. \n \n 1.

Email is just too slow, and they seldom if ever use snail mail. \n \n 3. \u201cGo West, Young College Grad\u201d has always implied \u201cand don\u2019t stop until you get to Asia\u2026and learn Chinese along the way.\u201d \n \n 4.

With increasing numbers of ramps, Braille signs, and handicapped parking spaces, the world has always been trying harder to accommodate people with disabilities. \n \n 9. Had it remained operational, the villainous computer HAL could be their college classmate this fall, but they have a better chance of running into Miley Cyrus\u2019s folks on Parents\u2019 Weekend. \n \n 10. Entering college this fall in a country where a quarter of young people under 18 have at least one immigrant parent, they aren't afraid of immigration...unless it involves \"real\" aliens from another planet. \n \n 11. John McEnroe has never played professional tennis. \n \n 12. Clint Eastwood is better known as a sensitive director than as Dirty Harry. \n \n 13.

        "Document": "Islamabad, Pakistan (CNN) -- A Pakistan government minister has personally offered a $100,000 reward for anyone who kills the man who made the anti-Islam movie that is drawing ire throughout the Muslim world. \n \n Railway Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour announced the bounty at a news conference Saturday, but he made clear to CNN he was speaking for himself and not as a government representative. \n \n Asked whether he was concerned about committing or condoning a crime as a government official, Bilour said, \"I am a Muslim first, then a government representative.\" \n \n Opinion: Pakistanis can debunk myths about Islam peacefully \n \n He said he invited the Taliban and al Qaeda to carry out the assassination. \n \n Sen. Zahid Khan, a spokesman for Bilour's political party, said the minister's action is not representative of the Awami National Party. \n \n \"We believe in nonviolence. How could we make such announcements?\" Khan said. \"Our party has been fighting against militancy and extremism for years. How could we invite Taliban and al Qaeda to kill someone? Taliban and al Qaeda are our enemies who have killed our loved ones.\" \n \n \"We have lots of concerns over the statement of our colleague,\" he added. \n \n The leftist Awami National Party is a coalition partner in the federal government led by President's Asif Ali Zardari's Pakistan People's Party. The ANP is a ruling party in northwestern province of Khyber Pakhtunkhwa. \n \n Photos: Anti-U.S. demonstrations worldwide \n \n Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf condemns the bounty issued by Bilour, his spokesman said Sunday. \n \n Shafqat Jalil said the prime minister will take up the issue with the head of the Awami National Party. \n \n Bilour did not mention the filmmaker by name, but he was likely referring to Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the man who U.S. officials say is behind the privately produced film. \n \n Nakoula and his family have already left their California home and gone into hiding amid the worldwide storm of protest, the Los Angeles County Sheriff's Department announced. \n \n Actress in anti-Islamic film files lawsuit against filmmaker \n \n CNN's Reza Sayah and journalist Aamir Iqbal contributed to this report. ||||| Image caption Dozens died in clashes between the police and protesters in Pakistani cities \n \n The US state department has condemned a Pakistani minister's offer of $100,000 (\u00a361,600) for the death of the American maker of an anti-Islam film. \n \n It said the step was \"inflammatory and inappropriate\". \n \n Railways Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour made the offer after a wave of protests against the film across Pakistan and the wider Muslim world. \n \n Dozens have died in clashes between police and protesters in Pakistan and countries such as Tunisia and Sudan. \n \n Sunday saw a fresh round of protests over the film in Pakistan, Nigeria, Greece and Turkey. \n \n Most passed off peacefully, but in the Greek capital Athens, riot police and demonstrators clashed. Six people were arrested. \n \n A state department official told the BBC: \"The president and secretary of state have both said the video at the core of this is offensive, disgusting, and reprehensible - but that is no justification for violence, and it is important for responsible leaders to stand up and speak out against violence. \n \n \"Therefore we find Mr Bilour's announcement is inflammatory and inappropriate. We note that the prime minister's office has dissociated itself from his comments.\" \n \n In hiding \n \n The exact origins of Innocence of Muslims, the low-budget film that has prompted the unrest, are unclear. \n \n The alleged producer of the trailer of the film, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, is in hiding. \n \n Anti-US sentiment grew after a trailer for the film dubbed into Arabic was released on YouTube earlier this month. \n \n US citizens have been urged not to travel to Pakistan, and the US embassy has paid for adverts on Pakistani TV showing President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemning the film. \n \n Although US targets have borne the brunt of protests against the film, anti-Western sentiment has been stoked further by caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published this week in the satirical French magazine, Charlie Hebdo. \n \n France shut embassies and other missions in about 20 countries across the Muslim world on Friday. \n \n An 18-year-old man who threatened the magazine's editors on Facebook has been charged with terrorism-related activity following his arrest in the southern French city of Toulon, a judicial source told AFP news agency on Sunday.",
        "Summary": "Ghulam Ahmad Bilour, Pakistan's Railway Minister, offered a $100,000 bounty for the killing of Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, the maker of an anti-Islam movie that has sparked worldwide protests. Bilour clarified that he was speaking for himself and not as a government representative. The Awami National Party, to which Bilour belongs, disassociated itself from his statement, emphasizing their stance against violence. Prime Minister Raja Pervez Ashraf and the US State Department condemned Bilour's offer, calling it inflammatory and inappropriate. The anti-Islam movie, made by Nakoula, has led to protests in countries like Pakistan, Tunisia, Sudan, Nigeria, Greece, and Turkey, resulting in deaths and clashes. Nakoula is currently in hiding due to the backlash. The US Embassy in Pakistan has aired adverts condemning the film, while France has shut its embassies in 20 countries following the publication of caricatures of Prophet Muhammad by Charlie Hebdo, which further fueled anti-Western sentiment.",

        "Document": "Animals and treatments \n \n Animal experiments were performed at Imperial College London except for high resolution magic angle spinning (HMRS) experiments which were performed at Instituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas \u2018Alberto Sols\u2019 (IIB). Experiments conducted at Imperial College London were approved by Imperial College London, and all animal procedures were performed in accordance with the UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986). IIB experiments were approved by the ethical committee of the Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas \u2018Alberto Sols\u2019 (and met the guidelines of the national (R.D. 53/2013) and the European Community (2010/62/UE) for care and management of experimental animals. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed in C57BL/6 male mice (6\u20138 weeks old, Charles River, Margate, UK) that were single-housed under controlled temperature (21\u201323 oC) and light conditions (12 h light\u2013dark cycle; lights on at 07:00 hours). \n \n The effect of HF-I versus HF-C on body weight and energy intake \n \n Mice were randomized and assigned to two different groups (n=12): HFD with cellulose as a control (HF-C), HFD+oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy) (HF-I). Synergy is a fructan-based preparation containing both long- and short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides. Synergy was mixed with the HFD individually in the ratio of 1:9. The two diets were isocaloric, each contained the same total energy of 4.6 kcal g\u22121, with 41.8% energy from fat. The diets were made isocaloric by the addition of cellulose. Nutritional composition of the diet is shown in Table 1. The diets were fed ad libitum for 8 weeks to respective groups of animals. Body weights and food intake were measured three times per week. \n \n Table 1: Nutritional content of the HFD-C and HFD-I diets. Full table Figures/tables index \n \n Determination of acetate concentrations in serum and faeces \n \n SCFAs were determined by gas chromatography in the colonic contents and serum of mice that where freshly culled. The method used was adapted from Richardson et al.35 Briefly, caecal contents were weighed (20\u2013220 \u03bcg) and combined with 550 \u03bcl of PBS. Samples were vortex mixed for 1 min, centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. To 500 \u03bcl supernatant, 25 \u03bcl of internal standard and 2-ethylbutyric acid was added to give a final concentration of 5 mmol l\u22121. Acids were extracted by the addition of 250 \u03bcl concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1 ml diethyl ether followed by vortex mixing for 1 min. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 g and the ether layer was removed and transferred to a separate capped vial. N-methyl-N-t-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Sigma) was added (100 \u03bcl) before heating at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min. \n \n Gas chromatography was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector, split/splitless injector and a 10-m, 0.18 mm ID and 0.20 \u03bcm df Rtx-1 (Crossbond 100% dimethyl polysiloxane, Thames Restek UK, Ltd) capillary column. Injector and detector temperatures were 275 oC with the column temperature programmed from 63 \u00b0C for 3 min to 190 oC at 10 \u00b0C per min. Helium served as the carrier gas (head pressure 135 kPa) and injections (1 \u03bcl) were made in the split mode (50:1 split). Peak areas were recorded and all subsequent data manipulation was completed using ChemStation Software (Agilent Technologies, USA). External standards for acetate, propionate, n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, n-valerate and caproate were prepared at concentrations of 25, 12.5, 6.25, 1.25 and 0.625 mM and ethyl butyric acid was used as the internal standard at a concentration of 100 mM. Reported values were normalized according to the weight of original sample used. \n \n Serum SCFA measurement \n \n A 100\u2013500-\u03bcl aliquot of serum was filtered through a 30-kDa micropartition system (Vivaspin RC VS02H22 filters, Sartorius Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) by centrifugation at 14,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 90 min. An internal standard solution (25 \u03bcl) consisting of 100 mM ethylbutyrate and 100 mM formic acid was added to 225 \u03bcl of the protein-free filtrate supernatant in a 2-ml Hichrom vial (Agilent Technologies, South Queensferry, UK). To measure SCFA, 1 \u03bcl of each sample was injected into a 5,890 Series II GC system (HP, Crawley, UK) fitted with a NukolTM Capilllary Column (30 m \u00d7 0.53 mm \u00d7 1.0 \u03bcm, SUPELCOTM Analytical, UK) and flame ionization detector. The carrier gas, helium, was delivered at a flow rate of 14 ml min\u22121. The head pressure was set at 10 p.s.i. with split injection. Run conditions were: initial temperature 60 \u00b0C, 1 min; +20 \u00b0C min\u22121 to 145 \u00b0C; +4 \u00b0C min\u22121 to 200 \u00b0C, hold 25 min. Peaks were integrated using Agilent ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies, Oxford, UK) and SCFA content quantified by single-point internal standard method. Peak identity and internal response factors were determined using a 1-mM calibration cocktail including acetate, propionate and butyrate. \n \n PET-CT analysis of acetate biodistribution \n \n Mice were fasted overnight. Animals received 11C-acetate (~20 MBq) at the beginning of PET scan either through i.v. tail vein (n=3) or colonically by using tubing placed 1 cm into the rectum (n=4). At the time of the scan, animals were anaesthetized with a 2\u20132% isofluorane\u2013oxygen mix. After the animals were placed in the micro PET/CT scanner (PET/CT (Siemens), a CT scan without contrast was performed, followed by the PET scan and lastly followed by a CT scan where contrast Ultravist 370 (Bayer, AG, Germany) was infused. \n \n During the scan, animals were maintained at 1\u20131% isofluorane\u2013oxygen mix and body temperature of 37 \u00b0C. The CT had an X-ray source of 80 kVp and 500 \u03bcA with exposure time 200 ms and isotropic resolution of 103 \u03bcm. The scan consisted of three bed positions with a 20% overlap. The CT scan was used for anatomical data and attenuation correction purposes. The PET system consisted of 64 lutetium oxyothosilicate based detectors blocks arranged in four contiguous rings, with a crystal ring diameter of 16.1 cm and an axial extent of 12.7 cm. Each detector block was composed of a 20 \u00d7 20 array of lutetium oxyothosilicate crystals coupled to a position sensitive photomultiplier tube via a light guide. Each crystal was 10 mm long and had a cross-sectional area of 1.51 \u00d7 1.51 mm. The crystal pitch was 1.59 mm in both axial and transverse directions. Inveon Research Workplace version 3 (Siemens) was used for data analysis. Images with matrix size 12 \u00d7 128, pixel size 0.776 mm2 and slice thickness 0.796 mm were reconstructed from the two-dimensional sinogram by two-dimensional-filtered backprojection using a ramp filter with a nyquist frequency of 0.5. Dynamic framing was used in reconstruction with 20 \u00d7 3 s frames, 8 \u00d7 30 s frames, 5 \u00d7 60 s frames and 10 \u00d7 300 s frames. Attenuation correction was also used to correct the image. Reconstructed PET images were then registered onto the CT images. PET signals on the desired region of interest were obtained over the scan period (1 h). Percentage injected dose (% ID per g) was calculated by using the following Equations (1) and (2), where; \u03bb=0.693/T 1/2 , T 1/2 is the half-life of the radionuclide, I t is activity at a given time where I 0 is the starting activity and t is the time passed, C PET is the contrast of the image and ID is the activity of the injected acetate. \n \n Effect of i.p. acetate on energy intake \n \n Mice were fasted overnight before receiving either 500 mg kg\u22121 sodium acetate dissolved in 0.9% saline (n=22) or vehicle control (0.9% saline; n=21) pH 7.0, This dosage of acetate was similar to that used to suppress lipolysis in previous studies and was shown to be well tolerated14. Food intake was measured 1, 2, and 4 h post injection. \n \n Effect of i.c.v. acetate on energy intake \n \n Male Wistar rats 190\u2013240 g (specific pathogen free; Charles River) were placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) under 0.5-2.5% isoflurane anaesthesia. A hole was drilled using a stereotactically mounted electric drill using coordinates calculated from the Rat Brain Atlas as described previously36, according to the coordinates of Paxinos and Watson37 (0.8 mm posterior to the Bregma in the midline and 6.5 mm below the surface of the skull). A permanent 22-gauge stainless steel cannula (Plastics One Inc., Roanoke, Virginia, USA) projecting to the third cerebral ventricle was implanted. Dental cement was used to hold the cannula in position anchored by three stainless steel screws inserted into the skull. The skin was approximated using nylon sutures. After a 7 day recovery period, animals were handled daily and acclimatized to the injection procedure. To ensure that cannulae were correctly positioned, rats received i.c.v. 150 ng angiotensin II in a 5-\u03bcl volume via a 28-gauge stainless steel injector placed into and projecting 1 mm below the tip of the cannula. Rats were observed for a prompt drinking response. A total volume of 5 \u03bcl was injected over 1 min to conscious, freely moving rats. For feeding studies, rats (n=15) were fasted overnight and then injected between 09:00 and 10:00 hours with sodium acetate (2.5 \u03bcmol) or an equivalent osmotic sodium chloride control (5 \u03bcl) and returned to their home cage. Food intake was measured at 1, 2 and 4 h post injection. After a 72-h washout period, rats received either the acetate or sodium chloride in a cross-over manner and food intake measured as previously described. \n \n Effect of liposome encapsulate acetate on food intake \n \n Nanoparticle design was based upon our previous studies where PEGylated liposomes were formulated for labelling and visualization of cells38, or specifically designed for preferential uptake in xenograft tumours15. Liposomes were prepared by the thin-film hydration method39. Liposomes were prepared with either acetate (1 M, pH 2.3) to form liposome-encapsulated acetate (LITA) nanoparticles or HEPES for use as a control. Particle size was determined using a Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments, UK). Quantification of acetate encapsulated within LITA nanoparticles was determined using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. LITA formulation (200 \u03bcl) was scanned with addition of albumin that binds to acetate in free solution reducing the NMR signal for the compound40. A liposome-free control solution containing an equivalent concentration of acetate (4 mM) was also scanned with and without the addition of albumin (2 g). LITA solution was scanned following the addition of lactate (5.2 mg sodium lactate) to act as a quantitative control. Spectra were obtained using a Bruker DRX 11.74T NMR spectrometer. Spectra were analysed using MestRe-C NMR spectroscopy software (Santiago de Compostela, Spain). \n \n To assess short-term biodistribution, a liposome formulation containing an additional 0.1% of a rhodamine\u2013lipid complex (DOPE-Rhodamine: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) was used to determine biodistibution through ex vivo histological analysis. Samples were collected 4 h post i.p. injection (n=4). No significant accumulation of liposome was observed in the brain of the treated mice despite being present in the liver and heart. \n \n The effect of acetate on behaviour \n \n Mice were fasted overnight before receiving either a single i.p. injection of saline, 500 mg kg\u22121 acetate or 2.5 M LiCl as a positive control for aversive behaviour41 (n=8 per group). The behavioural patterns of each mouse were observed for 15 s every 5 min from the time of injection until 1 h post injection. Behaviours was classified using a modified version of a previously published protocol42. Briefly, behaviours was classified into 10 different categories: feeding, drinking, locomotion (including rearing and climbing), bed making, burrowing, grooming, still, sleeping, head down (animal in abnormal body posture: back hunched, eyes shut or half-shut and pilo erect\u2014indicative of impaired health status) and tremors. \n \n Acetate tolerance test \n \n Glucose levels were determined from blood taken from mouse tails using a Glucometer Elite glucometer (Bayer Corp.). Experiments were performed on ad libitum fed mice at 14:00 h as previously described for insulin tolerance tests18 but instead of insulin, animals were injected i.p. with either 500 mg kg\u22121 sodium acetate or saline control (n=9\u201310). Blood glucose values were then determined at the times indicated. Results were expressed as fold change of initial blood glucose concentration before injections. \n \n Plasma PYY and GLP-1 hormone analysis \n \n All samples were assayed in duplicate and in a single assay to eliminate inter assay variation. Plasma PYY and GLP-1 were assessed using an established in-house radioimmunoassay as described previously43, 44. \n \n Hypothalamic quantitative PCR \n \n This was carried out using the methods described by Bewick et al.45 Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to study the expression of the different target genes. Total RNA was extracted from the whole hypothalami using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All samples were treated by DNaseI (Invitrogen) before the reverse transcription. First-strand cDNAs were prepared using 1 \u03bcg RNA and SuperScriptII Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of random hexamer and oligo(dT) primers (Promega, Charbonni\u00e8res-les-Bains, France). The qPCRs were performed using the Light Cycler Fast Start DNA Master SyBR Green I kit (Roche, Meylan, France) in the presence of specific primer pairs that were selected to amplify small fragments (100\u2013200 bp). PCR products were checked for specificity by measuring their melting temperature. Samples (in duplicate) were quantified by comparison with a standard curve obtained by dilutions of purified-specific cDNAs. \n \n Measurements of AGRP and POMC mRNA expression \n \n RNA was extracted from dissected hypothalamus using Absolutely RNA microprep kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA). The gene transcription for AgRP and POMC in the ARC of the hypothalamus was determined using real-time RT-PCR, and results were expressed as a ratio to the expression of the constitutive gene cyclophilin. The sequences of TaqMan probes and primers for cyclophilin (GenBank accession no. M15933) were: forward primer 5\u2032-CCCACCGTGTTCTTCGACAT; reverse primer 5\u2032-TGCAAACAGCTCGAAGCAGA-3\u2032; and probe 5\u2032-CAAGGGCTCGCCATCAGCCG-3\u2032. For AGRP, they were: forward primer 5\u2032-TTGGCAGAGGTGCTAGATCCA-3\u2032; reverse primer 5\u2032-AGGACTCGTGCAGCCTTACAC-3\u2032; and probe 5\u2032-CGAGTCTCGTTCTCCGCGTCGC-3\u2032. The probe and primers for POMC (assay identification no. Rn00595020_ml) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. \n \n Manganese-enhanced MRI \n \n MEMRI was performed using a 9.4-Tesla Varian INOVA imaging system (Varian Inc., USA) as described previously46. A fast spin-echo multi-slice sequence was applied with the following parameters: TR= 600 ms, TE=10 ms, matrix size= 256 \u00d7 192, FOV=25 \u00d7 25 mm and average=1 acquiring 46 \u00d7 0.4 mm thick slices. An array of 66 acquisitions was set up so that the 46 slices were acquired 66 times throughout the infusion. Normalized percentage enhancement in signal intensity was calculated for the ARC, VMH, PVN, periventricular nucleus (PE) and the nucleus of tractus solitarius27, 43. \n \n Hypothalamic measurement of AMP kinase \n \n Animals were killed by decapitation, brains were immediately dissected and the hypothalamus was removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues (~100 mg) were homogenized in 0.4 ml of ice-cold 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using an UltraTurax homogenizer (3 \u00d7 30-s bursts). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation of AMPK and western blot analysis. \n \n Immunoblotting and antibodies \n \n Samples were boiled in electrophoresis sample buffer and resolved on polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred into PVDF membrane (Immobilon-FL, Millipore) and blocked with PBS containing 5% skimmed milk powder for 1 h. Antibodies were diluted in 5 ml high salt Tween buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl and 0.5% Tween (v/v)), and incubated with the membrane. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting are as follows: anti-AMPK-\u03b21/2 (in-house) (dilutions 1:3,000\u20131:10,000 for blotting), anti-phospho-ACC (S79) (Cell Signalling, cat. no. 3661), anti-phospho-AMPK (PT172) (Cell Signalling, cat. no. 2535) anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, cat. no. A5316). \n \n Primary antibodies were detected using fluorescently linked secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor, Invitrogen, goat anti rabbit: A21109 and goat anti mouse: A21058). These were visualized using an Odyssey infrared imager (Li-Cor Biosciences). Quantification of results was performed using Odyssey software and expressed as a ratio of the signal obtained with the phospho-specific antibody relative to the appropriate total antibody. Full-length images of cut immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. \n \n The effect of acetate on hypothalamic metabolism \n \n [2-13C] acetate (500 mg kg\u22121) or [U-13C] inulin (100 mg) were administrated to 8\u201310-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Charles River, Spain) after an overnight fasting (16 h) either with i.p. (n=18) or by gavage (n=4), respectively. All mice were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane (3 l per min, 99% oxygen), and cerebral metabolism was arrested within 1.5 s using a high-power (5 kW) microwave fixation system (TMW-6402C, Muromachi Kikai Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) immediately (0 min), 15 and 30 min after acetate, or 180 min after inulin, administrations. Fixed brains were dissected and hypothalamus and remaining brain biopsies were obtained and maintained frozen (\u221280 \u00b0C) until HR-MAS analyses. 13C (125,03 MHz) and 1H HR-MAS (500,13 MHz) spectra were acquired at 11.7 T (4 \u00b0C, 4,000 Hz rotation) with a Bruker AVANCE wide bore spectrometer equipped with a MAS accessory (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). 1H-decoupled 13C HR-MAS spectra were acquired using a pulse-acquire sequence, with WALTZ-16 1H decoupling applied during the acquisition and relaxation delay periods. Conditions were \u03c0/4 pulses, 8,192 or 16,384 scans (for [2-13C] acetate or [U-13C] inulin measurements, respectively), 64 k data points, 5 s recycle delay. The 13C spectra were processed with Mestrelab ( http://mestrelab.com/). Chemical shifts of the 13C resonances were referred to the acetate C2 resonance (24.5 p.p.m.), and the 13C incorporation was normalized to the myo-inositol C1+C3 resonance (73.2 p.p.m.), which provides a useful internal reference from which all 13C resonances can be normalized independently of the amount of tissue20, 47, introducing appropriate corrections for nuclear Overhausser enhancement and saturation. \n \n 1H HR-MAS spectra from the same biopsies used for 13C HR-MAS acquisitions were acquired using the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gil sequence. Acquisition parameters were 5 s water pre-saturation, echo time=144 ms, t=1 ms, n=100, 10 kHz spectral width, 32 k data points and 256 scans. Metabolite concentrations were evaluated using a modified version of the LCModel processing software (Linear Combination of Model Spectra, http://s-provencher.com/pages/schtm)48. \n \n Statistical tests were performed using two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test between values in the different time points or areas. Observations that fell below the Q1-1.5 \u00d7 IQR (interquartile range) or above the Q3+1.5 \u00d7 IQR range (with Q 1 and Q 3 representing the upper and lower quartiles values and IQR, the difference between Q 3 and Q 1 ) were considered outliers and were not taken into account for statistical evaluations. \n \n Data analysis \n \n Analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) or Stata (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). All data was tested for normality using Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. Non-normally distributed data was log transformed to normalize the distribution. Comparison between groups was carried out by two-sided unpaired Student\u2019s t-test for two groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey or Bonferroni correction if there were more than two groups. I.c.v. cross-over acetate injection studies were compared using a two-sided paired Student\u2019s t-test. Given the cumulative nature of both MEMRI and PET signal intensity data, differences in signal intensity profile between the regions of interest in all experimental groups were analysed using GEE and the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test with commercial statistical software (Stata, version 9.1; StataCorp), which compare profiles for the entirety scan. All results and graphs are expressed as means\u00b1s.e.m. Results were considered statistically significant when P<0.05, with the significance level indicated as *P<0.05, **P<0.01 and ***P<0.001 ||||| Peter Cade/Getty \n \n A study of mouse metabolism suggests that a product of fibre fermentation may be directly affecting the hypothalamus, a region of the brain involved in regulating appetite. \n \n People have long been told that a diet high in fibre can help to fight obesity, but how it does so has been unclear. \u201cThere has been lots of epidemiological information showing a relationship between fibre and obesity, but no one has been able to connect the epidemiological results with actual mechanisms,\u201d says Jimmy Bell, a biochemist at Imperial College London who worked on the research, published today in Nature Communications1. \n \n Until now, a high-fibre diet was thought to help keep weight down by stimulating the release of appetite-suppressing hormones in the gut2, says Bell, but humans do not seem to show the same increase in these hormones that mice do. \n \n So Bell and his colleagues decided to look elsewhere. An obvious candidate, they thought, might be one of the products of fibre fermentation in the gut. In particular they focused on the short-chain fatty acid acetate, because it is the most abundant and is known to circulate throughout the bloodstream. \n \n They fed mice fibre labelled with carbon-13, which has an additional neutron from the more common carbon-12 that gives its nuclei a magnetic spin and therefore makes it easy to track as it progresses through the body's chemical reactions. The fibre was fermented as usual into acetate, which turned up not only in the gut, but also in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain known to be involved in regulating appetite. There, the researchers found, it was metabolized through the glutamine-glutamate cycle, which is involved in controlling the release of neurotransmitters associated with appetite control. The same model has been proposed for acetate metabolism after drinking alcohol. \n \n The mice fed with large doses of fermentable fibre ate less food, and ended up weighing less than control mice that were fed unfermentable fibre. \n \n 'Simplistic' approach \n \n William Colmers, an electrophysiologist who studies the effect of neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, says he thinks that the experimental work is solid, but worries that the results have been over-interpreted. \u201cMuch of it is extremely speculative,\u201d he says. For one thing, the dietary fibre levels were around 11%. At that level, \u201cthe room would be full of mouse farts\u201d, he says, so the animals may simply have been eating less because they were uncomfortable. \n \n Colmers adds that the hypothesis of how acetate in the hypothalamus was affecting the release of neurotransmitters to decrease appetite is \u201ca simplistic view of how the nervous system works\u201d. The release of neurotransmitters is \u201cexcruciatingly well regulated\u201d, he says, and not as sensitive to manipulation by changes in biochemistry as the authors suggest. \n \n Although the work was done in mice, Bell says that he sees \u201cno reason\u201d why the same mechanism shouldn\u2019t be at work in humans. \u201cAcetate is known to be metabolized in the human brain, and we have the right microbiota in our gut for the fermentation of fibre,\u201d he says. \n \n Bell and his colleagues are preparing to test their ideas in people. The question, however, is how much fibre do you have to eat? Most people's diet contains between 10 and 20 grams of fibre a day, and it can be difficult to increase this amount substantially. So Bell and his colleagues are working with companies that are looking into enriching fibre with acetate to boost the digestive system, and into ways of encasing acetate in nanoparticles so that it releases slowly throughout the day to help control appetite. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a way of having your cake, and not eating it,\u201d says Bell. ||||| A pill that switches off hunger is on the horizon after scientists discovered an \u2018anti-appetite\u2019 molecule which tells the body to stop eating. \n \n Researchers at Imperial College discovered that people feel full when eating fruit and vegetables because fibre releases acetate into the gut. \n \n They believe that a pill derived from acetate could be created to help people cut down on food without experiencing any cravings. \n \n One in four adults in England is obese and that figure is set to climb to 60 per cent of men and 50 per cent of women by 2050. \n \n Obesity and diabetes already costs the UK over \u00a35billion every year which is likely to rise to \u00a350 billion in the next 36 years. \n \n Large amounts of acetate are released when plants and vegetables are digested by bacteria in the colon. The scientists tracked the molecule and found that it eventually ended up in the hypothalamus region of the brain, which controls hunger. \n \n The new study suggests obesity has become an epidemic because we have replaced the healthy diet of the past with processed food, which does not react with gut bacteria to produce acetate. So the brain does not receive a signal telling it to stop eating. \n \n The average diet in Europe today contains about 15 g of fibre per day. In Stone Age times it was around 100g per day. \n \n \"Unfortunately our digestive system has not yet evolved to deal with this modern diet and this mismatch contributes to the current obesity epidemic,\u201d said Professor Gary Frost, of Imperial College. \n \n Although scientists say their research should encourage more people to eat more fruit and vegetables, they also believe it could pave the way for new drugs to help dieters. \n \n Prof Frost added: \"Our research has shown the release of acetate is central to how fibre suppresses our appetite and this could help scientists tackle overeating. \n \n \"The major challenge is to develop an approach that will deliver the amount of acetate needed to suppress appetite but in a form that is acceptable and safe for humans. \n \n \"Developing these approaches will be difficult but it is a good challenge to have and we are looking forward to researching possible ways of using acetate to address health issues around weight gain.\u201d \n \n The study analysed the effects of a form of dietary fibre called inulin which comes from chicory and sugar beets and is also added to cereal bars. \n \n Experiments on mice found those fed on a high fat diet with added inulin ate less and gained less weight than animals given a lot of fat diet with no inulin. \n \n They also noticed that the acetate acculmulates in the hypothalamus of the brain where it triggers a series of chemical events which fire neurons and suppress hunger. \n \n The research also showed when acetate was injected into the bloodstream, the colon or the brain it reduced the amount of food eaten by the mice. \n \n Prof Jimmy Bell, of the Medical Research Council, Cambridge, who collaborated in the research, said: \"It is exciting we have started to really understand what lies behind fibre's natural ability to suppress our appetite and identified acetate as essential to the process. \n \n \"In the context of the growing rates of obesity in western countries, the findings of the research could inform potential methods to prevent weight gain.\" \n \n Acetate is only active for a short amount of time in the body so an \u2018acetate pill\u2019 would need to be able to mimic the chemical\u2019s slow release into the gut. \n \n Prof David Lomas, chair of the MRC's population and systems medicine board, said it is becoming increasingly clear the interaction between the gut and the brain plays a key role in controlling how much food we eat. \n \n He added: \"Being able to influence this relationship, for example using acetate to suppress appetite, may in future lead to new, non surgical treatments for obesity.\" ||||| TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health \n \n Scientists have figured out the reason fiber is such a wonder food: It contains an anti-appetite molecule called acetate. \n \n Acetate, the researchers discovered, is naturally released when fiber is digested in the gut, and when it\u2019s released, it is taken to the brain where it signals us to stop eating. \n \n Fiber has long been known to satiate appetite and keep us full for longer, but previous research supposed the reason was that it takes longer to digest, keeping us satisfied for longer after we\u2019ve stopped eating. But this new research published in the journal Nature Communications shows that the acetate released when we digest roughage lowers our appetites when it gets directly into our bloodstream, colon or brain. \n \n The researchers looked at a dietary fiber called inulin, which comes from chicory and sugar beets, and is often present in cereal bars. They fed mice a diet high in fat with additional inulin. These mice ate less and gained less weight than mice who did not consume inulin, and when the scientists took a deeper look, they discovered that the inulin-eating mice had higher levels of acetate in their gut. So, they used PET scans to track the inulin through the mice. \n \n They discovered that the acetate traveled from the colon to the liver and heart, and finally made it to the the area of the brain that deals with hunger, the hypothalamus region. Using more imaging, they determined that the acetate accumulates and spurs chemical reactions in the brain that send signals that suppress hunger. \n \n Eating more fiber, found in foods like nuts, oatmeal, beans, lentils, apples and blueberries, is one of the better ways to feel full and satisfied, and can help with weight management. Science says so.",
        "Summary": "Animal experiments were conducted at Imperial College London and Instituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas \u2018Alberto Sols\u2019 (IIB), following respective ethical guidelines. The study primarily used C57BL/6 male mice to investigate the effects of high-fat diets with cellulose (HF-C) and oligofructose-enriched inulin (HF-I) on body weight and energy intake. The diets were isocaloric and fed ad libitum for 8 weeks. SCFAs were measured using gas chromatography, and PET-CT analysis was performed to study acetate biodistribution. Various experiments assessed the impact of acetate on energy intake, behavior, and hypothalamic metabolism. The research found that acetate, a product of fiber fermentation, affects the hypothalamus and regulates appetite, potentially offering new avenues for obesity treatment.",

Borch said she was \u201cdancing around it,\u201d trying to figure out what to do. \n \n \u201cImagine the Tasmanian devil,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was terrifying.\u201d \n \n The path was too narrow for Borch to run past the raccoon, which had begun lunging at her. With adrenaline pumping, Borch suspended her disbelief. \n \n \u201cI knew it was going to bite me,\u201d she said. \n \n Figuring she would have the greatest ability to defend herself if she used her hands to hold it down, she decided that probably would be the best place for the aggressive animal to latch on. \n \n The raccoon sank its teeth into Borch\u2019s thumb and \u201cwouldn\u2019t let go.\u201d Its paws were scratching her arms and legs wildly as Borch screamed and cried. \n \n In a matter of seconds, Borch, who could not unhinge the raccoon\u2019s jaw to shake it off her hand, noticed that when she had dropped her phone, it had fallen into a puddle in the path and was fully submerged. \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could strangle [the raccoon] with my bare hands,\u201d she remembers thinking, but holding it under the water might do the trick. \n \n Connecting the dots quickly, Borch, then on her knees, dragged the still biting raccoon, which was scratching frantically at her hand and arms, into the puddle. \n \n \u201cWith my thumb in its mouth, I just pushed its head down into the muck,\u201d Borch said. \n \n With the animal belly-up, she held its head under water. \u201cIt was still struggling and clawing at my arms. It wouldn\u2019t let go of my thumb,\u201d she said. \n \n Borch said she held it there for what felt like an eternity until finally it stopped struggling and \u201cits arms sort of of fell to the side, its chest still heaving really slowly.\u201d \n \n Hyperventilating and in hysterics, she pulled her thumb out of the raccoon\u2019s mouth, \u201cand then I just bolted as fast as I could through the underbrush,\u201d she said. \n \n Borch remembers looking back once to see if the raccoon had started chasing her again. \n \n \u201cIt felt like [Stephen King\u2019s] \u2018Pet Sematary,\u2019\u201d she said. \n \n Kicking her shoes off because they were soaked, Borch ran the three-quarters of a mile home to her house. \n \n Borch, who was screaming and unsure of how rabies affects humans, remembers thinking, \u201cOh, God, what if I just start foaming at the mouth and can\u2019t find my way back?\u201d \n \n She met her mother, Elizabeth, at home, and together they drove immediately to Pen Bay Medical Center. \n \n The dead raccoon was retrieved by Borch\u2019s dad, who packed it into a Taste of the Wild dog food bag and handed it over to the Maine Warden Service. \n \n Hope Animal Control Officer Heidi Blood confirmed Wednesday that the dead raccoon later tested positive for rabies by the Maine Center for Disease Control. \n \n \u201cNot to scare people,\u201d Blood said, but \u201cwhen there\u2019s one [infected], there\u2019s typically another.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s important to \u201clet folks know that just because there\u2019s one [infected] and it\u2019s gone now, doesn\u2019t mean the risk still isn\u2019t there,\u201d she said. \n \n Infected animals typically start showing signs within two weeks, Blood said. Humans can start exhibiting symptoms within a few weeks, she said, but often it takes a few months. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s scary stuff,\u201d Blood said. \u201cThe No. 1 thing we try to remind people of is that it\u2019s 100 percent fatal [if it goes untreated].\u201d \n \n Borch has received six shots so far, including the rabies vaccine, and immunoglobulin and tetanus injections. She is slated to receive her last injection this weekend. \n \n \u201cIf there hadn\u2019t been water on the ground, I don\u2019t know what I would have done,\u201d Borch said of drowning the animal. \u201cIt really was just dumb luck. I\u2019ve never killed an animal with my bare hands. I\u2019m a vegetarian. It was self-defense.\u201d \n \n Her advice for others who find themselves facing a rabid animal? Borch said she has none. \n \n \u201cI always thought of raccoons as this cute, cuddly forest animal,\u201d she said. \u201cI just will never look at them the same way.\u201d \n \n Borch is not the only person to have been attacked by a rabid animal so far this season. \n \n Earlier this week, a Wiscasset man was bitten on both hands in Topsham by what was believed to be a rabid fox. \n \n As of June 7, according to the Maine CDC, there have been 20 animals, including raccoons, red foxes and skunks, that have tested positive for rabies in 2017. \n \n In 2016, 64 animals in Maine tested positive for rabies, according to CDC data. \n \n Loading\u2026 ||||| HOPE \u2014 A woman who was attacked by a rabid raccoon while running in the woods near her home drowned the animal in a puddle after it latched onto her thumb. \n \n Rachel Borch, 21, said she was getting ready to go out for an afternoon run on June 3 when her brother Chris told her to be careful because he had seen a raccoon \u201cskulking\u201d around the yard. He told her he thought it odd that the raccoon, normally a nocturnal animal, was out in the daytime. \n \n Borch said she was running on a fire road next to her house when she encountered the animal. \n \n \u201cOut of nowhere, I see through the underbrush a very ferocious-looking raccoon charging at me with its teeth bared,\u201d Borch said. \n \n She immediately knew something was wrong with the animal by the way it was acting. \n \n \u201cIt was one of those moments like out of the \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 \u2013 this isn\u2019t real, this doesn\u2019t happen in real life, but then it was right there and it was right at my feet,\u201d she said. \n \n Borch said she started dancing around the animal, frantically trying to figure out what to do. \n \n \u201cThere was nothing I could do, it was going to bite me,\u201d she said. She had dropped her phone and had nothing to protect herself with. \n \n She figured that if it was going to bite her, it might as well be her hands. She put her hands out in front of her, and the raccoon latched onto her thumb. \n \n \u201cI was screaming and crying and trying to hold it down,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a few inches of really muddy water on the ground \u2013 it was a swampy area of the trail \u2013 so I just took all my strength and pushed it into the water.\u201d \n \n She said she pushed the raccoon\u2019s head underwater and held it there for what seemed like a very long time as it clawed her arms and continued to bite down on her thumb. \n \n \u201cIt happened so fast, but also in slow motion,\u201d Borch said. \n \n The state\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed June 5 that the raccoon tested positive for rabies. \n \n Rabies is caused by a virus, affects the brain and spinal cord and can cause death if left untreated, according to the Maine CDC. Rabies in people is very rare in the United States, but rabies in animals \u2013 especially wildlife \u2013 is common in most parts of the country, including Maine. \n \n The raccoon continued to move for a while while Borch kept its head underwater. She said she was afraid to let go for fear it would continue attacking her. Eventually, it released its paws and its jaws stopped clenching her thumb. \n \n Bleeding and crying, Borch ran home and screamed for her mother to call 911. Borch\u2019s father, Brad, and her brother retrieved the animal so another animal wouldn\u2019t drag it off and become infected. \n \n Hope animal control officer Heidi Blood said that if one animal tests positive for rabies, it\u2019s \u201calmost 100 percent\u201d certain there are other animals in the area also infected. Blood said that last summer, two raccoons in Lincolnville and one in Hope tested positive for rabies. \n \n Blood said an animal doesn\u2019t have to be aggressive to be infected; it can also act \u201cdelirious or drunklike.\u201d \n \n She said people and their pets should avoid such animals, even dead ones, because the rabies virus can live outside the body for 24 hours. \n \n Under Maine law, cats and dogs, even if they stay indoors, must be vaccinated against the disease. \n \n Borch is expected to receive the last of four rabies shots on Saturday, and has been taking antibiotics for the puncture wounds on her hands. \n \n \u201cYou just can\u2019t predict something like that,\u201d Borch said. \u201cI\u2019m still processing it, but that does not happen and that is not a normal thing.\u201d \n \n Share \n \n Want the news vital to Maine?

        "Summary": "Rachel Borch, a 21-year-old woman from Hope, Maine, was attacked by a rabid raccoon while jogging on a wooded trail near her home. The raccoon bit her thumb and wouldn't let go, prompting Borch to drown the animal in a puddle to defend herself. After the attack, she ran home and her mother, Elizabeth, drove her to Pen Bay Medical Center where she received multiple injections, including the rabies vaccine. The raccoon was later confirmed to have rabies by the Maine Center for Disease Control. Hope Animal Control Officer Heidi Blood warned the public about the ongoing risk of rabies in the area. Borch's brother, Chris, had earlier warned her about a raccoon he saw acting strangely. Borch's father, Brad, retrieved the dead raccoon to prevent other animals from becoming infected. Borch is expected to complete her rabies treatment soon.",

        "Document": "Google Inc. (GOOG)\u2019s new social-networking service, Google+, saw fewer U.S. visitors last week and users are spending less time on the site, signaling that its momentum may be slowing, according to Experian Hitwise. \n \n Total Google+ visits fell about 3 percent to 1.79 million in the U.S. in the week ended July 23 from the prior seven days, said Experian Hitwise, which tracks Web traffic. Google+ visits had risen 283 percent in the week ended July 16. The average time spent on the site in the most recent week declined 10 percent to 5 minutes and 15 seconds, the research firm found. \n \n Google+, an online tool started last month that lets users create and communicate with groups of friends, is the company\u2019s latest effort to challenge services such as Facebook Inc. and LinkedIn Corp. Google co-founder Larry Page, who took over as chief executive officer in April, announced earlier this month that Google+ had more than 10 million users -- less than three weeks after it started. \n \n \u201cWe are seeing over 1 billion items shared and received in a single day,\u201d Page said July 14 on a call with analysts. \u201cSo while we still have a lot of work still to do, we are really excited about our progress with Google+.\" \n \n Experian Hitwise\u2019s research methods, which rely on visits to websites, don\u2019t include mobile users and third-party application traffic, according to the New York-based company. \n \n Google+, which aims to help users better organize and manage contacts and sharing, began a test version on June 28 by invitation only. \n \n Google, based in Mountain View, California, fell $15.30, or 2.5 percent, to $607.22 today on the Nasdaq Stock Market. The shares have risen 2.2 percent this year. \n \n To contact the reporter on this story: Brian Womack in San Francisco at bwomack1@bloomberg.net \n \n To contact the editor responsible for this story: Tom Giles at tgiles5@bloomberg.net ||||| Tomorrow, it will be exactly a month since Google+ was first unveiled. In that short amount of time, they\u2019ve managed to sign up well north of 10 million users, which is amazing. Of course, the easiest path to tens of million of users is to start with hundreds of millions of users. Just ask Buzz or Wave. Still, kudos to Google \u2014 phase one of G+ was clearly a success. \n \n Now comes the hard part. Keeping those users around and engaged. \n \n Some numbers today released by Experian Hitwise suggest that Google+ has already started to experience the sophomore slump. For the week ended July 23 (last week), their data says that traffic decreased 3 percent versus the previous week. It\u2019s important to note that this data is U.S.-only, and that Google+ is still technically in limited beta (though it\u2019s easy to get an invite now). Still, the trend is the important thing: traffic is down week to week. \n \n While it\u2019s totally circumstantial, my own observations and usage seem to support this data as well. After initially checking it several times a day, I now load Google+ about twice a day, mainly to see if I\u2019m missing anything. I rarely find that I am. I +1 a few things here and there, maybe leave a comment. But overall, the content feels fairly stale. Almost everything shared remains about Google (or worse, Google+ itself). And even though I have nearly 370 people in my circles, very few seem to be sharing anything in any sort of limited fashion with me. \n \n As a \u201cpower user\u201d, I know that I\u2019m a bit of a weird use case when it comes to sharing. But others I\u2019ve talked to in the past couple weeks have had similar observations. Google+ started off with a bang \u2014 a big one. Part of it was the new car smell, but a bigger part was that expectations were so low for what Google would come up with in the social space (their own doing). When Google exceeded those expectations, people were genuinely surprised. And that also spurred usage. There was a sense of excitement: Could this really be the next big social network? \n \n But now things are calming down. The new car smell is wearing off. And it\u2019s time for reality. \n \n Google gave users a compelling reason to sign up, now they need to provide a compelling reason for coming back. That\u2019s a lot easier said than done. Just ask Twitter. User retention is a bitch. \n \n Google has their secret weapon: the (ugly) black toolbar that resides across all of their properties. If it weren\u2019t for that thing, my usage of Google+ would be once a day instead of twice a day. But even that won\u2019t matter in the long run if Google doesn\u2019t have the network and the content to back up G+. In addition to an overall traffic dip, average time spent on the site was down 10 percent, Hitwise says. That\u2019s not good. \n \n From what I\u2019ve seen, Hangouts are the major strong point of Google+ retention right now. While Sparks seem to be a major weak point. \n \n Circles, while initially praised for their simplicity and design, are now also facing backlash. The fact of the matter is that they\u2019re a pain in the ass to maintain \u2014 just like every other type of list. And aside from \u201cFriends\u201d, \u201cFamily\u201d, and maybe \u201cCo-Workers\u201d, it\u2019s still not clear how they\u2019re being used, or if usage will continue. Well, aside from the Robert Scoble Circle. That is useful. \n \n Meanwhile, after an initial amazing burst, traffic referred from Google+ is dropping. And fast. Obviously, I can only speak to the TechCrunch data here. But again, the trend is clear. Each of the past three weeks, we\u2019ve been seeing less and less traffic referred. And that\u2019s with the overall network supposedly growing. \n \n Part of that may be Google\u2019s own fault. They really screwed up the brand situation. They even gutted one of our employees who just wanted to share content. \n \n It would be hard to overstate just how important this second phase of Google+ is for Google. While they\u2019re not a small startup limited by resources and money, they still only get one chance to make a first impression. In the first two weeks, that impression was very good. In the last two, not as good. \n \n I\u2019m sure this post will get a hundred comments on Google+ about why I\u2019m wrong, an idiot, something about Apple, and why Google+ is the bomb. I\u2019d argue that this may be a part of the overall problem \u2014 one we\u2019ve seen before. But that\u2019s beside the point. It doesn\u2019t matter what anyone says. All that matters is what Google does with Google+.",
        "Summary": "Google+ saw a decline in U.S. visitors and average time spent on the site, indicating a potential slowdown in momentum. Experian Hitwise reported a 3% drop in visits and a 10% decrease in average time spent. Google+ had initially seen rapid growth, with over 10 million users and 1 billion items shared daily, as announced by Google co-founder Larry Page. Despite this, user engagement appears to be waning, with traffic and content sharing decreasing. Hangouts are a strong point for retention, while Sparks and Circles face challenges.

        "Document": "BERKLEY (WXYZ) - October 6, 1966. \n \n \n \n It was the day Roger Watson was drafted, and the day he met a friend who never quite left his memory - Dave Brown. \n \n \n \n Dave remembers Roger too. \n \n \n \n Both men were from northwest Detroit and went through basic Army training together in Fort Hood, Texas. They became fast friends. Then they went home for a month before serving in Vietnam. \n \n \n \n \u201cAfter that, we never did see one another,\u201d Dave recalls. \n \n \n \n Dave had heard that Roger was wounded early in his tour, but never learned if he had survived. \n \n \n \n After returning home, Roger got married, had kids and settled down on Franklin Road in Berkley. He would wonder, from time to time, whatever happened to his Army friend, Dave. \n \n \n \n About five years ago, Roger befriended a neighbor whose backyard lied kitty-corner to his. Her name was Peggy Brown. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe\u2019d sort of wave and it went from a wave to coming up the fence to chatting a little bit,\u201d Roger described. \n \n \n \n The two bird watched together and later exchanged emails to share pictures of birds. \n \n \n \n Little did Roger know, Peggy was married to Dave Brown. \n \n \n \n The pieces began falling together late October when Peggy noticed Roger was a wounded vet. She saw the Purple Heart logo on his license plate. Then she noticed the baseball cap visible from the back window of Roger\u2019s car that read, \u201c9th Infantry.\u201d It was the same infantry Dave had served in. \n \n \n \n The rest unraveled quickly through a rapid series of emails between Peggy and Roger. \n \n \n \n \u201cTo tell you the truth, I was flabbergasted,\u201d Dave said. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve been neighbors for 18 years and didn\u2019t realize, here we were,\u201d Roger said. \n \n \n \n The odds are probably slimmer than the fence that separates their yards. A meeting - in the yard - was quickly arranged. \n \n \n \n \u201cHe came running out of the house, over to the corner, had to beat back the brush, we just shook hands and couldn\u2019t believe it,\u201d Roger said. \u201cIt was just an incredible feeling, just amazing,\u201d he added. \n \n \n \n A long-lost friendship, reclaimed after almost half a century. \n \n \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re going to share a beer every now and then, and we\u2019re going to be seeing a lot more of each other,\u201d Roger smiled. \n \n \n \n \u201cGrow very old and watch our grandchildren grow up,\u201d Dave said. \n \n \n \n When you have decades of catching up to do, it helps to live just 150 feet apart. \n \n ||||| Buy Photo Roger Watson, left, and David Brown have been neighbors in Berkley for 18 years, but didn\u2019t realize until recently that they were friends in the Vietnam War, drafted on the same day, trained in the same places and served in the same company. (Photo: Ryan Garza Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo \n \n Dave Brown had scoured the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington looking for his Army basic training buddy Roger Watson's name. \n \n While in Vietnam in 1968, Brown ran into someone from Watson's company and heard that his friend had been injured. \n \n The word was true \u2014 Watson was shot March 8, 1968, seven months into his tour, losing a kidney and 3 feet of small intestine and suffering damage to his liver. \n \n But Brown never found out if his friend lived or died. \n \n The two men \u2014 who came from the same northwest Detroit neighborhood, were drafted on the same day in 1966, trained together at Ft. Hood in Texas, served in the 9th Infantry and were combat engineer demolition specialists \u2014 never saw or heard from each other again. \n \n Until right before Halloween this year. \n \n That's when the two men \u2014 more than 40 years older than the last time they saw each other as young soldiers in training \u2014 walked across their kitty-corner backyards in Berkley and met at the chain-link fence. \n \n For 18 years, the two Oakland County men had lived nearly back to back and didn't even know it. \n \n Weeks after reuniting, they still can't believe it. \n \n Vietnam vets and long-lost friends David Brown and Roger Watson of Berkley found out they have been neighbors for 18 years. Ryan Garza/Detroit Free Press \n \n \"I was absolutely delighted,\" Brown, 68, a retired surveyor, said of learning about Watson, grateful his friend survived. \"I wondered about you for 40 years.\" \n \n \"I always wondered what happened to you,\" Watson, 67, a retired supervisor with the Michigan Department of Corrections, told Brown as the two sat in Watson's home recently, sipping coffee, sharing war stories and telling their amazing reunion story. \n \n That story is a story in itself. \n \n And it's thanks to Brown's wife, Peggy, who has been neighborly with Watson because of their common interest in birds. \n \n Peggy Brown was taking a walk one day when she noticed the Purple Heart license plate on Watson's car and mentioned it to her husband. On another occasion, she noticed the 9th Infantry Vietnam Veterans cap in the rear window of the car. \n \n Then, on Oct. 27, the revelation happened \u2014 during e-mail exchanges between her and Watson that began about a picture of a hawk. \n \n \"On a different subject my husband Dave was in the ninth infantry 15th combat engineers' 1967-1968 Vietnam. Wondering if you were there at that time. \u2026 I saw that you were in the ninth,\" she wrote Watson. \n \n The back-and-forth e-mails that followed unraveled answers to questions pondered by both men for four decades. \n \n \"Small World!!!!!!\" and \"Wow !!!!\" and questions, such as whether Watson's nickname was Bunny (it wasn't) and if Dave Brown's hair was blond (it was), were sprinkled through the evolving exchanges. \n \n \"I think we may have volunteered together,\" Watson wrote Peggy Brown. \"Please don't believe any stories he may tell about me! Also let him know I've changed a lot since basic.\" \n \n After looking at photos of the men as soldiers via e-mail that day, Peggy Brown wrote: \"This has to be coincidence of the century. Dave cannot believe all this and we've been here for 18 years in Berkley. What are the odds?\" \n \n That's been the reaction of the men, their wives and the friends they've told since the long-lost Army buddies found each other again. \n \n \"It takes one little piece of information to put the whole thing together,\" said Watson's wife, Edie. \n \n Roger Watson said he saw only glimpses of his neighbor from a distance now and then through the years. \n \n When the foliage is out, both couples said, it's impossible to see into each others' backyards. Roger Watson said he simply was friends with Peggy Brown \"over the fence\" as both of them fed the birds. \n \n \"I was almost shaken,\" Roger Watson said of learning his Army buddy was his neighbor. \"This is almost too wild.\" \n \n \"This is incredible,\" Dave Brown said. \"It's amazing. So much time has elapsed.\" \n \n But to hear the men \u2014 now longtime husbands, fathers and grandfathers \u2014 talk recently, it was like no time had passed at all. \n \n They recalled being drafted, training in Texas \u2014 running everywhere, cleaning the barracks and spit-shining shoes \u2014 and leaving for life-changing experiences in Vietnam while their hometown of Detroit was experiencing its own life-changing event in the 1967 riot. \n \n Watson talked about when he was shot; Brown recalled the first body he encountered as a soldier. \n \n The experiences are among many etched in the memories of both men \u2014 memories neither can shed, just like the smell of diesel or the sound of a helicopter. \n \n Now, they have another memory \u2014 discovering each other. \n \n \"It's sort of amazing we've been neighbors this long,\" Watson said. \n \n Brown agreed. \n \n \"It's just great to see him alive,\" he said. \"It makes me happy.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1BaPhDJ",

        "Document": "Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) suggested that any decisions about whether to run again for his seat would not come until the weekend at the earliest. Earlier this week, Mr. Rubio opened the door to another run, saying that the shooting massacre in Orlando on Sunday had led him to consider how he might best [\u2026] ||||| Friends for 20 years, Marco Rubio and Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera were at the scene of the Orlando massacre on Sunday when they had an unusually frank conversation about their political futures. \n \n \u201cYou should reconsider running for your seat,\u201d Lopez-Cantera told Rubio as they sat in the senator\u2019s pickup truck about an hour before sunset, after witnessing the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Rubio was caught off guard. After all, Lopez-Cantera has been running for his Senate seat in a crowded GOP primary for more than a year \u2014 with Rubio\u2019s encouragement. \n \n Lopez-Cantera made clear he was still fully committed to running, even as he initiated a gut-check moment for both of them. Until then, Rubio had resisted the entreaties of Senate leaders and donors to rethink retiring from the Senate. Lopez-Cantera\u2019s conversation removed one of the biggest obstacles to Rubio running again: a longtime friendship that he wouldn\u2019t want to ruin due to political ambition. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to say that because of outside pressure,\u201d Rubio responded. \n \n But Lopez-Cantera said he felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to continue talking it through. The two of them were shaken by what they saw in Orlando, the bloody sidewalks and the ashen faces of local, state and federal authorities. \n \n \u201cThis is bigger than me. And this isn\u2019t about me. And it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about our country and this election,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said to Rubio, recounting the conversation for Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply consequential. \u2026 In the current field, I\u2019m the best candidate in the general election. But I\u2019m not looking at this through rose-colored glasses.\u201d \n \n Bottom line, Lopez-Cantera said in the interview: \u201cNothing has changed. I\u2019m still running. Marco isn\u2019t.\u201d \n \n The filing deadline for the race is June 24, when Rubio is scheduled to hold a fundraiser for Lopez-Cantera. If Rubio decides to run, Lopez-Cantera won\u2019t file. Right now, longtime friends of both men believe Rubio ultimately won\u2019t run: The lure of a much bigger paycheck and proximity to his family will outweigh another term in the Senate. \n \n But in the next breath, they say no one really knows what Rubio will do, except the senator himself \u2014 and even he might still be agonizing over the decision. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ll go home later this week, I\u2019ll have some time with my family,\u201d Rubio told reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday as he headed to a classified briefing on the Orlando attacks. \u201cIf there\u2019s been a change in our status, I\u2019ll be sure to let everyone know.\u201d \n \n Polling shows Rubio is the strongest Republican in a potential race against the Democrats\u2019 strongest candidate, Rep. Patrick Murphy, in a contest that could decide control of the Senate. \n \n The Republican Senate race is crowded. And the full-court press to recruit Rubio to run for reelection has frozen fundraising and dampened Republican enthusiasm for all five major GOP candidates for the seat. None is as well known as Rubio. \n \n Some Republican and conservative groups have suggested they won\u2019t spend big in Florida, while more donors will give to oppose Rubio in order to hand him his second defeat in a year and brand him a double loser after his crushing loss in the presidential primary. \n \n As part of the maneuvers to get Rubio to reverse course, Lopez-Cantera and allies of his and Rubio\u2019s say the amount of disinformation spread by party insiders has been somewhere between staggering and absurd. \n \n For weeks, Lopez-Cantera and Rubio had privately mocked the rumors of them striking a deal or hatching some elaborate plot. In one telling, Rubio would run for reelection, win and then resign before the 2020 presidential election cycle, at which point Lopez-Cantera would run for his seat. In another version, Lopez-Cantera agreed with moneyed interests to drop out of the Senate race, endorse Rubio and then run for chief financial officer in 2018. \n \n All of it is false, Lopez-Cantera said. \n \n \u201cThere is no deal. There is no plan,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said. \u201cNone of it is true. Anyone who says that is lying and doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d \n \n But those who haven\u2019t been privy to the two friends\u2019 talks have been deeply skeptical about what they\u2019re up to. And if Rubio ultimately runs and Lopez-Cantera doesn\u2019t, some of the rumors will appear true. \n \n \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me this hasn\u2019t been orchestrated,\u201d said one Republican who supports one of Lopez-Cantera\u2019s rivals in the Senate race said, echoing Democrats. \u201cMarco is running and you can talk about all the friendship stuff you want, but this shows Marco is all about Marco.\u201d \n \n The campaign of one of Lopez-Cantera\u2019s Republican opponents, developer Carlos Beruff, fell for one of the rumor-filled reports and issued a statement Wednesday about Rubio in which the candidate said voters are \u201csick of career politicians and power brokers in Washington who care about one thing: holding on to power. But the voters of Florida will not obey them. They don\u2019t get to pick our candidates.\u201d \n \n As for the other Republican candidates, U.S. Rep. David Jolly said he\u2019ll announce his plans Friday. He might run for reelection to his Tampa Bay-area 13th Congressional District seat. Defense contractor Todd Wilcox indicated he\u2019ll stay in the race with or without Rubio, and those close to U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis say he\u2019d give strong consideration to running for reelection in the 6th Congressional District if Rubio runs. \n \n Lopez-Cantera acknowledges that his decision to bring up the race \u2014 especially after witnessing the aftermath of the carnage at the Pulse nightclub \u2014 put unexpected extra pressure on Rubio. \n \n Rubio\u2019s plans since last spring were to win the White House or return home to West Miami, where he lives less than a half-hour away from Lopez-Cantera\u2019s Coral Gables home. Rubio has hired Washington dealmaker Robert Barnett to field job offers and get the biggest payday possible, without lobbying or working on Wall Street. He also planned to hit the paid-speaker circuit. \n \n After two years, if Hillary Clinton wins this election, Rubio is expected to begin mounting a challenge to her in 2020. \n \n \u201cMarco ran for president as a senator and we saw how that played out,\u201d said one backer. \u201cThis is his chance to be at home, spend time with Jeannette [Rubio\u2019s wife] and their kids and make some real money so he can put all four of them through private college in the Northeast if he wants to. People forget he\u2019s the son of blue-collar immigrants. Things like this are more important to him than politics.\u201d \n \n Lopez-Cantera, who is also married and has two children, emphasized the importance of family to Rubio. \n \n \u201cUntil I mentioned this, he was really committed to spending time with his kids, being able to be home for more than 10 days without having to go somewhere on the campaign trail or back to Washington. He looked forward to coaching his son\u2019s football team,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said. \n \n Miami-Dade County Commissioner Steve Bovo, whose wife works as a policy adviser for Rubio, said he wasn\u2019t surprised by Lopez-Cantera\u2019s discussion. Bovo served in the Florida House when Lopez-Cantera was majority leader just after Rubio left as Florida House speaker, a post he held in 2007-08. \n \n \u201cCarlos is not only thinking about their friendship but the country,\u201d Bovo said. \u201cWe all know each other, go to each others\u2019 kids\u2019 birthday parties. In the difficult business we\u2019re in, we separate the friendship and the politics. But we never do anything to endanger our friendship.\u201d \n \n One Rubio insider said he believes Rubio should run for reelection because, as a senator, he\u2019ll have more ability to affect policy he cares about, raise money and draw attention. \n \n \u201cFrom a political perspective, this is about having a platform,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cWhen CNN calls, does the booker want former Sen. Marco Rubio or do they want, say, current Sen. Tom Cotton?\u201d \n \n A member of the Committee on Foreign Relations and Select Committee on Intelligence, Rubio has made foreign policy a specialty. And, friends say, he\u2019ll miss getting classified briefings and being in a position to do something about it. \n \n About 12 hours after Rubio and Lopez-Cantera spoke on Sunday, the senator was interviewed by conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt, who likes to talk about foreign policy and the threat of terrorism. Hewitt unexpectedly switched gears on Rubio by asking whether the terrorist attack changed \u201cin any way your resolve not to seek reelection.\u201d \n \n Briefly caught flat-footed, Rubio said \u201cI\u2019ve been deeply impacted by it. I think when it visits your home state, and it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about, you know, your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country.\u201d \n \n \u201cI have a friend of mine who is running for the U.S. Senate,\u201d Rubio said later. \u201cSo I want to be fair, Hugh. I haven\u2019t thought about it in that context. I really don\u2019t want to link the two things right now, because I don\u2019t want politics to intrude in all of this.\u201d \n \n By then, though, it was too late. \n \n \u201cI brought this up. It wasn\u2019t mutual,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said. \u201cHe is in a position where he will make a decision. We\u2019re friends. We support each other.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n Seung Min Kim contributed to this report. \n \n",
        "Summary": "Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) is contemplating whether to run for his Senate seat again, influenced by the recent Orlando shooting. Rubio, who had previously encouraged his friend Carlos Lopez-Cantera to run for his seat, was caught off guard when Lopez-Cantera suggested he reconsider running. Despite the pressure from Senate leaders and donors, Rubio has been resistant to the idea of not retiring. Lopez-Cantera remains committed to his candidacy but emphasized the importance of family to Rubio. Polls show Rubio as the strongest Republican candidate against Democrat Rep. Patrick Murphy. Rubio has hired Robert Barnett to explore job offers and is expected to challenge Hillary Clinton in 2020 if she wins the presidency. The Orlando shooting has deeply impacted Rubio, leading him to reconsider his service to the country. The decision is expected to be made by the weekend, with the filing deadline for the race on June 24.",

The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Chelsea Bailey \n \n Conservative commentator Laura Loomer was banned from using Uber and Lyft after she posted a series of anti-Muslim tweets following the terrorist attack in New York. \n \n A spokesman for the ride-hailing service Lyft confirmed Thursday that Loomer's account had been \"deactivated\" following her daylong tweetstorm that blamed Islam and Muslims for the deadly attack. \n \n A representative for Uber also confirmed that Loomer was banned permanently from using the service. \n \n Loomer launched into an anti-Muslim rant on Twitter Wednesday, calling for a new ride sharing company to be created that didn't employ Muslims, after it was revealed that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack, was a former Uber driver. \n \n \"Someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver,\" Loomer tweeted, tagging both companies in the post. \n \n The tweet marked the beginning of a daylong anti-Islamic social media attack that blamed all Muslims for ISIS terrorism. Loomer also posted a photo of two women wearing hijabs near the intersection where Tuesday's attacks occurred, writing \u201cI bet they\u2019re loving this.\u201d \n \n Hours later, she re-tweeted reports that she\u2019d been banned from both ride-sharing services. The 24-year-old has responded to the ban by announcing that she will be taking legal action against both companies. \n \n Related: Milo Yiannopoulos' 'Free Speech' Week Canceled \n \n \u201cUber will literally hire an Islamic terrorist, but they will ban a conservative journalist for addressing legitimate safety concerns,\u201d she tweeted. \n \n The backlash to Loomer's rant was swift and vocal, with many critics accusing the online agitator of stoking racism in the wake of a tragedy. Celebrities also criticized Loomer\u2019s posts, with model Gigi Hadid tweeting that she\u2019s a \"f***ing moron,\" and actress Alyssa Milano posting that she\u2019d reported Loomer to Twitter for hate speech. \n \n The blowback seemed to embolden Loomer, who continued tweeting about the ban Thursday. \n \n Loomer describes herself as an independent journalist, but many of her critics have labeled her a vocal member of the alt-right.

        "Document": "The New York Times also faced criticism for publishing the Color Purple author\u2019s recommendation without qualification \n \n The New York Times Book Review and Alice Walker have come under criticism for comments the celebrated writer made in an interview with the publication in which she recommended a work by someone accused of antisemitism. \n \n How David Icke helped unite Labour's factions against antisemitism | Rachel Shabi Read more \n \n Asked what books were currently on her nightstand, Walker, the author of The Color Purple, mentioned among others And the Truth Shall Set You Free, by the controversial British figure David Icke. Icke, an author and public speaker in his own right, has long propounded a series of conspiracy theories in his work that many see as antisemitic. \n \n \u201cThe book is an unhinged antisemitic conspiracy tract written by one of Britain\u2019s most notorious antisemites,\ufffd? wrote Tablet magazine\u2019s Yair Rosenberg, among the most strident critics of Walker\u2019s comment. Rosenberg also faulted the Times for failing to react to or qualify the contents of the book to its readers. \n \n Icke has long claimed that a shadowy cabal controls the world, a familiar antisemitic trope. \n \n Dave Weigel (@daveweigel) Uh, have we talked about Alice Walker keeping a David \"shapeshifting Lizard People control the universe\" Icke book on her nightstand? https://t.co/5HMBOcggeb pic.twitter.com/4pojRibVeb \n \n \u201cAnd like many conspiracy theorists, Icke claims that this secret conspiracy happens to be Jewish,\ufffd? Rosenberg added. \n \n Ideas in the book in question and much of his other work revolve around concepts expressed in the fraudulent antisemitic propaganda text The Protocols of the Elders of Zion. \n \n This isn\u2019t the first time Walker has expressed her affinity for Icke\u2019s work or been accused herself of antisemitism. In 2013 Walker praised another Icke book in an interview for the British radio show Desert Island Discs. \n \n Danny Gold (@DGisSERIOUS) Apparently this isn't the first time Alice Walker has publicly exposed her unhinged anti-Semitism? pic.twitter.com/vfMGXMwHw3 \n \n A poem of hers from last year called It Is Our (Frightful) Duty has also been derided as antisemitic as well. \n \n \u201cBy the Book is an interview and portrait of a public person through the lens of books; it is not a list of recommendations from our editors,\ufffd? a New York Times spokesperson has said following the backlash. \n \n Rebecca Pierce\ud83d\udd78 (@aptly_engineerd) This Alice Walker thing is really fucking sad and it makes me angry that she can\u2019t see that the anti-Jewish conspiracies she uplifted and adopted are part of the same white supremacist power structure she so deftly fought through her written work in the past \n \n \u201cThe subject\u2019s answers are a reflection on that person\u2019s personal tastes, opinions and judgments. As with any interview, the subject\u2019s answers do not imply an endorsement by Times editors. Moreover, our editors do not offer background or weigh in on the books named in the By the Book column, whether the subject issues a positive or negative judgment on those books. Many people recommend books Times editors dislike, disdain or even abhor in the column.\ufffd? ||||| Over the weekend, the New York Times Book Review published a full-length interview with Alice Walker, the Pulitzer Prize-winning author of The Color Purple. The very first question: \u201cWhat books are on your nightstand?\u201d Walker replied with four, the second of which was: \n \n \u201cAnd the Truth Shall Set You Free,\u201d by David Icke. In Icke\u2019s books there is the whole of existence, on this planet and several others, to think about. A curious person\u2019s dream come true. \n \n This passed without comment from the New York Times interviewer, and the publication passed it on to readers without qualification. This is rather remarkable because the book is an unhinged anti-Semitic conspiracy tract written by one of Britain\u2019s most notorious anti-Semites. \n \n A former soccer player turned professional hate peddler, Icke is one of the most influential conspiracy theorists in Europe, and certainly in Britain. Today, he has over 777,000 followers on Facebook, and speaks to audiences around the world. Like many conspiracy theorists, Icke claims that a secret conspiracy controls the world. And like many conspiracy theorists, Icke claims that this secret conspiracy happens to be Jewish. In And the Truth Shall Set You Free, the word \u201cJewish\u201d appears 241 times, and the name \u201cRothschild\u201d is mentioned 374 times. These references are not compliments. Indeed, the book was so obviously anti-Semitic that Icke\u2019s publisher refused to publish it, and he had to print it himself. \n \n In the book and elsewhere, Icke draws liberally upon the infamous anti-Semitic pamphlet, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\u2014a Russian forgery about an alleged global Jewish cabal that is widely considered one of the most influential anti-Semitic works in history. Magnanimously, Icke calls the hate tract by a different name. As he writes in the book promoted by Alice Walker: \n \n In the very late 1800s, a controversial document came to light called the Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion. I call them the Illuminati Protocols and I quote many extracts from them in The Robots\u2019 Rebellion. Some say they were a forgery made public only to discredit Jews, and I use the term \u2018Illuminati Protocols\u2019 to get away from the Jewish emphasis. If they were a forgery, something that is quite possible, what were they a forgery of, and by whom? The authors of the best-selling book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, conclude that the original Protocols were indeed authentic. \n \n Realizing that this may not convince readers of his good intentions, Icke attempts to head off charges of anti-Semitism by casting himself as a moderate in the reasonable debate over whether a Jewish conspiracy does in fact control the world: \n \n I believe that researchers over the years who have blamed the entire conspiracy on the Jewish people as a whole are seriously misguided; similarly, for Jewish organisations to deny that any Jewish person is working for the New World Order conspiracy is equally naive and allowing dogma or worse to blind them to reality. \n \n So, is Icke anti-Semitic? Well, here are some other things that he says in the book: \n \n \u2022 The Talmud is \u201camong the most appallingly racist documents on the planet.\u201d \n \n \u2022 B\u2019nai Brith, the world\u2019s oldest Jewish service organization, was behind the slave trade (an anti-Semitic canard popularized by Louis Farrakhan) and controls the Ku Klux Klan: \u201cB\u2019nai B\u2019rith means \u2018Sons of the Alliance\u2019 (Ed: Actually, \u2018Children of the Covenant\u2019) and was established in 1843. Many of its speakers openly supported slavery during the American Civil War and it covertly supports and controls the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d \n \n \u2022 Racist far-right groups are actually Jewish fronts. \u201cIn Britain,\u201d he writes, \u201cI am told by an extremely reliable source very close to the intelligence organisations that the \u2018far Right\u2019 group, Combat 18, is a front for the sinister Anti-Defamation League, the United States and of the \u2018Israeli\u2019/Rothschild secret service, Mossad. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has been operating in Britain and Europe since at least 1991 and its role is to brand as anti-Semitic anyone who is getting close to the truth of what is going on. What better way to discredit an investigator than to have a \u2018far Right\u2019 group like Combat 18 to praise them?\u201d (The \u201c18\u201d in \u201cCombat 18\u201d refers to the first and eighth letters of the alphabet: A and H, for Adolf Hitler.) \n \n \u2022 Jews are behind anti-Semitic attacks: \u201cIf you really want to discredit someone, you arrange for anti-Jewish or anti-whatever events such as the smashing of graves, assaults on people, even a terrorist bomb in the extreme. You then point the finger at your target person or group. You say they are either directly responsible or \u2018incited\u2019 the actions by what they are writing and saying.\u201d \n \n \u2022 Quotes and seconds the heinous assertion of Gary Allen\u2014the John Birch Society spokesman and former George Wallace speechwriter\u2014that Jews bankrolled their own extermination in the Holocaust: \n \n The Jewish members of the conspiracy have used an organisation called The Anti-Defamation League as an instrument to try to convince everyone that any mention of the Rothschilds and their allies is an attack on all Jews. In this way they have stifled almost all honest scholarship on international bankers and made the subject taboo within universities. Any individual or book exploring this subject is immediately attacked by hundreds of ADL communities all over the country. The ADL has never let the truth or logic interfere with its highly professional smear jobs \u2026 Actually, nobody has a right to be more angry at the Rothschild clique than their fellow Jews. The Warburgs, part of the Rothschild empire, helped finance Adolf Hitler. \n \n \u2022 Equates the anti-Semitic Nazi media of the Third Reich with a company that closed down a publication after it printed Holocaust denial: \u201cWhat is the difference between the controlled anti-Jewish media under Hitler and the way the Japanese magazine, Marco Polo, was closed down by its parent company in 1995 because of a campaign by the global Jewish hierarchy to stop its advertising revenue after it published an article questioning some of the official stories of the Nazi concentration camps?\u201d \n \n \u2022 Calls on schools to teach the controversy about whether the Holocaust really happened: \u201cWhy do we play a part in suppressing alternative information to the official line of the Second World War? How is it right that while this fierce suppression goes on, free copies of the Spielberg film, Schindler\u2019s List, are given to schools to indoctrinate children with the unchallenged version of events? And why do we, who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go to prison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, for suggesting another version of history?\u201d \n \n (Icke never does explain how Jews could have funded the Holocaust if the Holocaust didn\u2019t actually happen.) \n \n As can be seen from these extracts, and the chapter titles of the work (\u201cMaster Races,\u201d \u201cThe Hidden Hand\u201d), anti-Semitism is not incidental to Icke\u2019s book, it is essential. It is impossible to miss it. (And we have not even touched on Icke\u2019s climate change denial, 9/11 trutherism, and anti-vaccination misinformation.) \n \n This is the book that Alice Walker recommended to New York Times readers. \n \n That a celebrated cultural figure like Walker would promote such a self-evidently unhinged bigot might seem surprising at first glance. But this is only because the cultural establishment has spent years studiously looking away from Walker\u2019s praise of Icke and his work, and her repeated expressions of anti-Semitism. \n \n Back in June 2013, Walker wrote an effusive blog post showering accolades on Icke and his book Human Race Get off Your Knees. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing book, HUMAN RACE GET OFF YOUR KNEES,\u201d she enthused, \u201cand reading it was the ultimate reading adventure. I felt it was the first time I was able to observe, and mostly imagine and comprehend, the root of the incredible evil that has engulfed our planet.\u201d \n \n In May 2013, Walker told the BBC\u2019s Desert Island Discs that if she could have only one book, it would be Icke\u2019s Human Race. \n \n In December 2013, Walker offered end-of-year thanks to an array of \u201cbeloved humans who\u2019ve stuck their necks out for the collective.\u201d One of them was David Icke, whose Human Race Get off Your Knees book also got its own entry. \n \n In July 2015, Walker shared an interview between David Icke and Alex Jones, his American analogue. The account that posted the video has since been banned from YouTube. \n \n In September 2016, Walker promoted a lecture of Icke\u2019s to her readers, writing, \u201cI decided to find, among Icke\u2019s numerous videos, one lecture that might offer an introduction that wouldn\u2019t be too scary for folks leery of being nudged in a direction of inquiry that might upset, destroy possibly, their worldview. I think this one might fit the bill.\u201d YouTube has since taken down that lecture. \n \n In November 2017, Walker posted an explicitly anti-Semitic \u201cpoem\u201d on her blog titled, \u201cIt Is Our (Frightful) Duty to Study the Talmud.\u201d The composition blames all the world\u2019s ills, from Israel to America, on the ancient Aramaic compendium of Jewish law and lore, and checks nearly every anti-Semitic box, from attacking Jews as Christ-killers to claiming that Jews view gentiles as \u201csub-human.\u201d A representative excerpt: \n \n For the study of Israel, of Gaza, of Palestine, \n \n Of the bombed out cities of the Middle East, \n \n Of the creeping Palestination \n \n Of our police, streets, and prisons \n \n In America, \n \n Of war in general, \n \n It is our duty, I believe, to study The Talmud. \n \n It is within this book that, \n \n I believe, we will find answers \n \n To some of the questions \n \n That most perplex us. Where to start? You will find some information, \n \n Slanted, unfortunately, \n \n By Googling. For a more in depth study \n \n I recommend starting with YouTube. Simply follow the trail of \u201cThe \n \n Talmud\u201d as its poison belatedly winds its way \n \n Into our collective consciousness. Some of what you find will sound \n \n Too crazy to be true. Unfortunately those bits are likely \n \n To be true. Some of the more evasive studies \n \n Will exhibit unbelievable attempts \n \n At sugar coating extremely disagreeable pills. \n \n But hang in there, checking \n \n And double checking, listening to everybody, \n \n Even the teachers with the twisted pasts \n \n That scare you the most, \n \n And the taped rants of outraged citizens that sound \n \n Like madcap characters on Car Talk \n \n Except they are not laughing \n \n But are righteously outraged. Study hard, with an open \n \n If deeply offended mind, \n \n Until you can sift the false \n \n From the true.

Was his mother, Mary, \n \n A whore? Are Goyim (us) meant to be slaves of Jews, and not only \n \n That, but to enjoy it? \n \n Are three year old (and a day) girls eligible for marriage and intercourse? \n \n Are young boys fair game for rape? \n \n Must even the best of the Goyim (us, again) be killed? \n \n Pause a moment and think what this could mean \n \n Or already has meant \n \n In our own lifetime. \n \n Anti-Semitic slanders of the Talmud\u2019s contents are almost as old as the Talmud itself, and are one reason why Albert Einstein advocated that it be translated into English, \u201cin order to cut the ground from under certain malevolent attacks, of anti-Semitic origin, which borrow countenance from the obscurity and inaccessibility of certain passages in the Talmud.\u201d Clearly, Einstein did not anticipate the likes of YouTube-educated Talmud scholars like Alice Walker. \n \n And yet, despite all of this, Walker has never been held accountable by elite cultural critics for repeatedly promoting Icke and anti-Semitism. In fact, this is not even the first time the New York Times helped give her a coveted and uncritical platform: in 2015, New York Times theater reporter Michael Paulson interviewed Walker at the New School to mark the premiere of The Color Purple musical revival on Broadway. He did not ask her about anti-Semitism, despite collecting questions in advance on Twitter, several of which raised the issue, likely because it would have been too uncomfortable. \n \n Normally, this is where I\u2019d say that it was good that the Times published Walker\u2019s Icke recommendation because it lets us know who she is. But we have known who she is for many years. It is rather the Times and other cultural elites who have opted to ignore this inconvenient fact. Thus, the only thing that is accomplished by uncritically disseminating Walker\u2019s bigoted book bon mots is ensuring that the racism is disseminated to more people. \n \n Why has Walker escaped accountability for so long? Perhaps it is due to her Israel politics, which have been used to confuse the issue. Walker is a prominent supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, famously forbidding The Color Purple from being translated into the language of Hebrew. Because Walker\u2014like Icke\u2014is a strident critic of Israel, her defenders\u2014like Icke\u2019s\u2014have dismissed allegations of anti-Semitism by claiming they are merely an attempt to quash her criticism of the Jewish state. \n \n But it should not surprise anyone that the world\u2019s only Jewish state, home to half its Jews, would attract the attention of anti-Semites, who would use the legitimate debate over its conduct to smuggle in their anti-Jewish bile. Anti-Zionism may not be anti-Semitism, but plenty of self-described anti-Zionists are anti-Semites. A progressive left that is serious about anti-Semitism will call it out not only when it comes from a white supremacist and is presented as \u201crace realism,\u201d but when it comes from their own camp and is presented in the righteous guise of \u201canti-Zionism.\u201d \n \n Not publishing anti-Semitic book recommendations unchallenged in the New York Times would be a good place to start. \n \n Yair Rosenberg is a senior writer at Tablet.

They had no place in their psyches to fathom their abuse: Subjected to every kind of depravity and horror, during the passage and after, they arrived to be forced onto platforms and bid on, a process that could drag on and on, as plantation owners rejected those for whom they had no use. Africans were \u201cbroken in\u201d physically, and broken down spiritually, to such an extent they became what they had not been in their homelands or halfway through the voyage: slaves. This treatment, deliberately calibrated to destroy their inner sovereignty, was called \u201cseasoning.\u201d In Daniel Black\u2019s extraordinary book \u201cThe Coming,\u201d we have an unprecedented opportunity to be with ancestors who probably never dreamed a scribe would one day appear to make their descendants not only imagine their plight but also, by being brought to tears by the narrative, gain access to an emotion that makes us one with them.

They appreciated my first poem: \u201cEaster lilies pure and white, blossom in the morning light.\u201d Their praise, when I was 3 or 4, gave me permission to be a poet, with all the intrigue and adventure that would later involve.

        "Summary": "The New York Times faced criticism for publishing Alice Walker's recommendation of David Icke's book 'And the Truth Shall Set You Free' without qualification. Alice Walker, the celebrated author of 'The Color Purple,' has been accused of antisemitism for her praise of Icke's work, which is known for its antisemitic conspiracy theories. Yair Rosenberg of Tablet magazine criticized both Walker and The New York Times, describing Icke's book as an unhinged antisemitic conspiracy tract. Icke's work draws heavily on the infamous antisemitic pamphlet 'The Protocols of the Elders of Zion.' Despite previous instances of Walker expressing similar views, including in a 2013 interview on Desert Island Discs and her poem 'It Is Our (Frightful) Duty,' she has largely escaped accountability. A New York Times spokesperson clarified that the 'By the Book' column does not imply endorsement by the editors. Rebecca Pierce expressed sadness and anger at Walker's antisemitic views, highlighting the contradiction between her past work against white supremacy and her current stance.",

        "Document": "Image caption Kolkata zoo has three white tigers, including two females \n \n Officials at the Alipore zoo in the Indian city of Kolkata (Calcutta) say their attempts to mate a young tiger have been unsuccessful with the big cat showing little interest in mating. \n \n Vishal, the 10-year-old white tiger, has so far spurned the advances of tigress Rupa, living in the adjoining enclosure, an official told the BBC. \n \n Libido enhancers have also failed to spur him into action, he said. \n \n Experts blame his \"shyness\" on the fact that Vishal has been bred in captivity. \n \n \"For the past six months we've been trying to mate Vishal,\" Dayanarayan Banerjee, who retired as the senior veterinary officer at the zoo and is now working as a veterinary consultant there, told the BBC. \n \n \"We have de-wormed him to improve his overall health. We have given him libido enhancers, including vitamin D, A and E. But he is shy and no libido has been noticed in him,\" he said. \n \n Mr Banerjee says this is the first time an attempt has been made to mate Vishal - the only male in the breeding age in the zoo - but perhaps he is a bit too old to mate. \n \n \"The most suitable age for a tiger to mate is when he is five-six years old. Seven-eight-year-olds also succeed. But beyond the age of 10 years, it is very difficult.\" \n \n Mr Banerjee said when Vishal was introduced to eight-year-old Rupa, he was \"friendly enough\" and \"displayed no sign of hostility\", but that's where the contact ended. \n \n \"Rupa was willing, but Vishal was reluctant,\" he added. \n \n Mr Banerjee says he is \"not sure Vishal will deliver\" but zoo authorities are not yet giving up on the exercise. \n \n \"We are considering introducing him to Rani, she is a Bengal tigress, and she has a very beautiful face. But she is in an enclosure that's far away from Vishal's and we are awaiting a decision on whether we can move her to a nearby enclosure.\" ||||| Zeeshan Jawed \n \n \n \n KOLKATA: His intimidating roar terrifies humans but his partner's mating call breaks him into a cold sweat. Officials at Alipore zoo are faced with a rather strange situation where one of their young male tigers is showing little or no interest in mating despite several not-so-subtle hints dropped by his female partner. No amount of aphrodisiac or libido stimulant has been successful in making him, er, rise to the occasion. Vishal and Rupa are the young white tiger couple in this much-anticipated captive breeding project. Alipore zoo has five tigresses and only three tigers. Vishal and Rupa, aged 10 and eight, were selected for their youth and vigour after the State Zoo Authority gave permission to resume captive breeding last year. But Vishal's performance \u2014 or the lack of it \u2014 has come as a major downer. \"We chose Vishal because he is the youngest and physically the most well-built among the male tigers. But we cannot understand what happens to him when he sees Rupa. He runs away with his tail between his legs,\" said Dayanarayan Banerjee, senior veterinary officer at the zoo. Medical officers and zoo keepers who have been closely monitoring the behaviour of the tiger and the tigress, said that when Rupa enters her oestrus cycle \u2014 a period of \"heat\" when she is sexually receptive and makes advances \u2014 Vishal shows zero interest. \"Once Rupa enters her oestrus cycle, she makes mating calls and tries to get close to Vishal. She scratches his back with her nails, tries to make physical contact and even chases him. But Vishal runs in the opposite direction,\" said Banerjee. After noticing his indifference, medical officers administered vitamins A and E last year to enhance Vishal's sexual appetite. When that did not get his blood thumping, the doctors administered a libido enhancer but even that did not lift Vishal's mood. \"None of it worked. Vishal kept snubbing Rupa's advances,\" said a zoo official. Perplexed, zoo authorities consulted experienced veterinary officers and specialists who attributed his demeanour to shyness due to captivity and not necessarily to lack of virility. \"Vishal has grown up in captivity due to which he has never interacted with the opposite sex earlier. He is shy and often unable to understand the biological signals his body is giving him,\" said a big cat specialist in the forest and wildlife department. The breeding of tigers in the zoo is very important for several reasons, say veterinary officers. \"Mating is a biological need of any living being and it is required to stay healthy. Second, the big cats in the zoo are not getting any younger. If we want a younger generation of tigers here in the years to come, we have to work on it right now,\" said Banerjee. The last time a tiger cub was bred in the zoo was more than a decade ago. Though several big cats were young at that time and ready to procreate, senior officials in the wildlife department were not willing to take any risk lest the tigers injure each other during the mating. When some officials have taken the initiative now, the age and the attitude of the tigers does not permit that. \"Tigers can be ferocious during mating. They may harm their partner if they get over excited or angry about something. Most of the directors over the last decade did not want to take any risk and kept postponing the mating process,\" said a senior official in the department. The breeding of tigers has become a challenge for zoo officials who have otherwise achieved major successes with giraffes, zebras, macaws and barking deer. \"We have a good mix of these animals where the young ones are regularly spawning. In case of lions and tigers we do not have the same advantage because most of them are past their prime,\" said Kanai Lal Ghosh, director of Alipore zoo. The zoo authorities aren't about to give up on Vishal yet \u2014 maybe a much younger tigress will get his mojo working. Officials are toying with the idea of setting up Vishal with the much nubile Rani. \"She is young and full of vigour. We are hoping she will succeed in enticing Vishal,\" said a veterinary officer. The question is will Vishal rise to the occasion this time? \n \n",

Experts say the drug reduces the urge to drink and can be prescribed alongside counselling support. \n \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has published formal guidance recommending nalmefene, following draft guidance released in October, which means that patients have the right to request the drug if they meet certain requirements. \n \n Nalmefene, also called Selincro, is suitable for anyone who regularly drinks high amounts of alcohol, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as 7.5 units a day for men and five units a day for women. It helps patients gradually cut back on their alcohol intake and is therefore not suitable for anyone with a severe alcohol problem who needs to stop immediately. The pill costs \u00a33, can be taken up to once a day, and is designed to be used whenever the patient wants to stave off the desire to drink. \n \n Lyndsey Dudley, a spokeswoman for Nice, said the drug would be suitable for people who \u201cprobably don\u2019t even recognise themselves as an alcoholic\u201d. \n \n She said: \u201cIt is much like a patch that you might wear to give up smoking, to support you to cut down on your alcohol intake.

Thirty-five thousand people are expected to be given nalmefene as part of treatment for alcohol dependency in the first year. However, the actual figure might prove to be lower. Data released yesterday for Scotland, where nalmefene was approved for use in October last year, show that only 53 people were prescribed the drug in 2013/14. The 35,000 figure is based on the prediction that 58,000 people are expected to receive psychosocial intervention for mild alcohol dependency, of whom 60% will be given nalmefene. \n \n Dudley said the figure may change as \u201cpeople might not want to go down the medication route straight away\u201d. \n \n Information given by the drug\u2019s manufacturer Lundbeck identifies fictional examples of the sort of people eligible for nalmefene, including Sue, 39, who \u201clooks forward to a glass of wine after work when the kids go to bed but always finishes the bottle while cooking and eating with her husband, and opens a second bottle a few days each week\u201d. \n \n Professor Carole Longson, Nice\u2019s health technology evaluation centre director, said: \u201cMany people have a difficult relationship with alcohol even though they have a very stable lifestyle, maintain jobs and a social life and would not automatically assume they have a problem. But regularly drinking over the recommended daily amount of alcohol can seriously damage your health. \n \n \u201cThose who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services and taking part in therapy programmes. We are pleased to be able to recommend the use of namelfene to support people further in their efforts to fight alcohol dependence. \n \n \u201cWhen used alongside psychosocial support nalmefene is clinically and cost effective for the NHS compared with psychosocial support alone.\u201d \n \n Professor Jonathan Chick, a medical adviser for Drinkaware, said: \u201cTwo glasses of wine per day is not by any definition \u2018mild alcoholism\u2019.

That key procedural vote ended up passing, clearing the way to her eventual confirmation. \n \n \"He voted against her in committee and opposed cloture. That is why he spoke on the floor about it, has given numerous interviews, and written an op-ed the topic. \n \n Once cloture was invoked it was clear she would be confirmed and Cruz strongly chastised his Republican colleagues who supported her.\" \n \n Carpenter added that his vote against cloture was \"the only vote that mattered.\" \n \n \"After that it was done deal,\" she said. \n \n Cruz had opposed Lynch's confirmation on the grounds that she, like outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder, would continue to support President Obama's executive action on immigration. \n \n \"The Republican majority, if it so chose, could defeat this nomination, but the Republican majority has chosen to go forward and allow Loretta Lynch to be confirmed,\" Cruz said on the Senate floor. \"I would note there are more than a few voters back home that are asking what exactly is the difference between a Democratic and Republican majority when the exact same individual gets confirmed as Attorney General, promising the exact same lawlessness, what's the difference?\" \n \n Lynch was confirmed 56-43, five months after Obama nominated her. ||||| John Shinkle/POLITICO Cruz, vocal Lynch critic, skips confirmation vote \n \n Sen.

Those responsible for her confirmation are the ones who voted for cloture.\u201d \n \n The senator has drawn scrutiny over his attendance record in his short time on Capitol Hill. POLITICO reported earlier this week that Cruz has missed the vast majority of hearings for the Armed Services Committee, is below-average in attendance on his other major committees and ranks 97th during the first three months of this year in showing up for Senate floor votes. \n \n Cruz missed another key Senate vote this week \u2014 to pass a sex trafficking bill that was caught up for weeks due to an abortion-related dispute. The vote was 99-0, and Cruz was the sole missing senator then, too. ||||| WASHINGTON\u2013After missing votes on two Texas judicial nominees and a pivotal human trafficking bill, Sen. Ted Cruz came back to the Capitol on Thursday to oppose attorney general nominee Loretta Lynch\u2019s confirmation \u2014 and to accuse fellow Republicans of rolling over for the White House by agreeing to install her as nation\u2019s chief law enforcement officer. \n \n The nomination passed by a 56-43 vote Thursday afternoon. Sen. John Cornyn voted no and Cruz was the only senator to miss it, despite his objections. \n \n Cruz missed the confirmation vote so he could catch to Texas, said spokeswoman Catherine Frazier in an email. She also said Cruz led the charge against Lynch\u2019s confirmation and those who allowed the vote to proceed are responsible for its success. \n \n Cruz is expected to be in Dallas on Thursday for a fundraiser hosted by investor Tom Hicks. \n \n \u201cThe Republican majority, if it so chose, could defeat this nomination. But the Republican majority has chosen to go forward and allow Loretta Lynch to be confirmed,\u201d he said on the Senate floor. \u201cThere are more than a few voters back home that are asking what exactly is the difference between a Democratic and Republican majority when the exact same individual gets confirmed as Attorney General, promising the exact same lawlessness.\u201d \n \n Cruz asserted that Lynch would continue a pattern of partisan lawlessness started by current Attorney General Eric Holder. \n \n \u201cI very much wanted to support Loretta Lynch\u2019s nomination,\u201d said Cruz. But he said, her defense of Obama\u2019s executive actions on immigration and refusal to distance herself from Holder\u2019s views on assorted views maker her unfit and unsuitable for the job. \n \n Cruz has been intensely critical of Holder and has repeatedly called for his resignation. But he\u2019s been in no hurry to see Lynch installed as the replacement. He voted against cloture \u2013 the procedure to end a filibuster \u2013 but was on the losing end of a 66-34 vote that cleared the way for a final vote on confirmation. \n \n Unlike Cruz, Cornyn, the party\u2019s deputy leader, voted for cloture. A dispute over his bill to combat human trafficking had stalled the Lynch vote. Cornyn also has called for Holder to resign. \n \n Video of Cruz\u2019s floor remarks here.",
        "Summary": "On Thursday, Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Tex.) criticized President Obama's nominee for attorney general, Loretta Lynch, on the Senate floor, arguing she was unsuitable for the job due to her support for Obama's executive actions on immigration and her alignment with outgoing Attorney General Eric Holder's policies. Despite his vocal opposition, Cruz missed the final vote on her confirmation, the only senator to do so, as he attended a fundraiser in Dallas and a meeting of the Republican Jewish Coalition in Las Vegas. Cruz's spokesman and campaign representatives emphasized that his vote against cloture was the critical one, as it was clear Lynch would be confirmed once cloture was invoked. The Senate confirmed Lynch with a 56-43 vote. Cruz's absence and his criticism of his Republican colleagues for allowing Lynch's confirmation have drawn scrutiny, especially given his attendance record in the Senate.",
