        "Summary": "The Gold King Mine spill turned the Animas River orange-brown. The EPA triggered the discharge. Durango stopped pumping water, and the sheriff closed the river. Residents watched the flow, which slowed through the Animas Valley, arriving after 8 p.m. About 1 million gallons of acidic water with heavy metals flowed into Cement Creek and the Animas River. Durango urged water conservation, monitored fish, and New Mexico took precautions. The water contained iron, zinc, and pH levels dropped.",
        "Document": "Acidic wastewater from an abandoned mine above Silverton coursed its way through La Plata County on Thursday, turning the Animas River orange-brown, forcing the city of Durango to stop pumping raw water from the river and persuading the sheriff to close the river to public use. \n \n Residents lined the banks of the Animas River on Thursday afternoon to watch the toxic wastewater as it flowed through Durango city limits. But the sludge slowed as it snaked its way through the oxbow in the Animas Valley, and the murk didn't arrive until after 8 p.m. \n \n The accident occurred about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Gold King Mine in San Juan County. A mining and safety team working on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency triggered the discharge, according to a news release issued by the EPA. \n \n The EPA's team was working with heavy equipment to secure and consolidate a safe way to enter the mine and access contaminated water, said Richard Mylott, a spokesman for the EPA in Denver. The project was intended to pump and treat the water and reduce metal pollution flowing out of the mine into Cement Creek, he said. \n \n The disaster released about 1 million gallons of acidic water containing sediment and metals flowing as an orange-colored discharge downstream through Cement Creek and into the Animas River. \n \n River closure \n \n The Animas River was closed to tubers, rafters and kayakers Thursday as the toxic plume made its way through Durango. The closure went into effect at 3 p.m., and it will remain in effect indefinitely until the river is deemed safe, said La Plata County Sheriff Sean Smith. Government officials aren't certain what toxins and at what levels toxins are present in the river, and, therefore, decided it was best to close the river to public use. \n \n The closure, which applies to all flotation devices, is in effect for the entire stretch of the Animas River in La Plata County. \n \n \u201cThis decision was made in the interest of public health after consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, San Juan Basin Health Department and representatives of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEPA test results of the Animas River are expected within 24-48 hours, and the order will be re-evaluated at that time.\u201d \n \n City to conserve water \n \n The city of Durango stopped pumping water out of the Animas River on Wednesday to prevent contaminating the city reservoir. \n \n The Animas is an important secondary source of water for the city during the summer, and residents need to conserve as much water as possible over the next few days until the water is safe to use, said Steve Salka, the city's utilities director. \n \n No formal water restrictions were issued. \n \n At south City Market, Sean Lumen, who was hoisting bottled water onto emptied shelves, said if customers continued to buy water at Thursday's rate, the store would run out sometime Friday. \n \n At Albertsons, front-end manager Shelley Osborn said she initially thought people were buying up bottled water at an unusually rapid rate because it was on sale. Aaron Memro, grocery manager, estimated Albertsons sold two pallets of water Thursday \u2013 far more than usual. \n \n During the emergency, Salka will not send raw water to Hillcrest Golf Club or Fort Lewis College for grounds use. The city also will not water any city-owned parks for the next three days to help conserve, he said. \n \n On hot summer days, the city can use up to 9.2 million gallons a day. But the city can pump only 5.3 million gallons a day out of the Florida River. \n \n The city reservoir was about 4.5 feet below capacity on Wednesday, Salka said. \n \n \u201cThis couldn't happen at a worse time for me, so I have to be really cautious,\u201d he said. \n \n Fish habitat \n \n The EPA downplayed the potential effects on aquatic life, saying there are long-standing water-quality impairment issues associated with heavy metals in Cement Creek and upper portions of the Animas River. As a result, there are no fish populations in the Cement Creek watershed, and fish populations have historically been impaired for several miles downstream of Silverton in the Animas River, the release said. \n \n Colorado Parks and Wildlife placed four cages containing fish in the Animas River to monitor what happens to them, said spokesman Joe Lewandowski. The cages were placed at 32nd Street, the fish hatchery, Dallabetta Park and the High Bridge. \n \n \u201cWe'll see if those fish survive,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cWe're also monitoring to make sure we don't get infiltration into the hatchery, because that could be a problem.\u201d \n \n Peter Butler, co-coordinator of the Animas River Stakeholders Group and former chairman of the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission, said it remains to be seen whether the toxic metal concentrations flowing downriver will impact the few fish species living below Bakers Bridge. But if the plume does have a negative impact on aquatic life, Butler estimated that fish would die within hours of contact with the plume. \n \n The contaminated water made its way to Bakers Bridge in La Plata County by Thursday morning and hit town by Thursday evening. The material was expected to cross the New Mexico state line between 4 and 5 a.m. Friday and arrive in Farmington on Friday evening. \n \n Farmington city officials shut down all water-supply intake pumps to avoid contamination and advised citizens to stay out of the river until the discoloration has passed. \n \n Local officials asked all agricultural water users to shut off water intakes. \n \n What's in the water? \n \n Butler said the water being discharged from Gold King carried high concentrations of iron, aluminum, cadmium, zinc and copper. \n \n While he didn't know precisely the metal levels in the water that surged out of Gold King on Wednesday, Butler said: \u201cI'm sure they were really high.\u201d \n \n Though Gold King has no record of emitting mercury, Butler said \u201cwhen old mines open up like that, mercury sometimes drains out. Possibly, some other metals might have been released, like lead and arsenic. But there's no evidence of that at this point.\u201d \n \n Butler said Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety scientist Kirstin Brown had tested pH levels \u2013 the telltale measure of acidity in water \u2013 in the Animas River at Trimble Lane when the toxic plume arrived. \n \n The pH level dropped from 7.8 to 5.8. \n \n \u201cThat's a pretty big drop,\u201d Butler said. \n \n Silverton does not use water from Cement Creek, so its water source remained uncontaminated, said William Tookey, the San Juan County administrator who met Thursday with EPA officials. \n \n The Animas River was looking healthier about 24 hours after the discharge in Silverton, he said. \n \n Gold King problems \n \n This is not the first time there has been a water-related accident at one of the mines, but it did come as a surprise to the town, Tookey said. \n \n He was not sure if the release would change attitudes toward the EPA in town. For years, some town residents and local officials have been opposed to a Superfund listing. \n \n \u201cSince it was the EPA that was responsible for this, it may make people less likely to be open to them,\u201d he said. \n \n Butler said everyone invested in improving the Animas River's water quality wanted to get into Gold King, because, for years, it has been one of the two biggest contributors of heavy-metal loads in the Animas Basin. \n \n \u201cThey had a plan for handling the mine pool, but something went wrong, and it all came blowing out,\u201d Butler said. \n \n EPA teams will be sampling and investigating downstream locations over the next several days to confirm the release has passed and poses no additional concerns for aquatic life or water users. ||||| DENVER (AP) \u2014 A plume of orange-ish muck from million-gallon mine waste spill in Colorado was headed down river to New Mexico, prompting communities along the water route to take precautions until the sludge passes. \n \n People kayak in the Animas River near Durango, Colo., Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015, in water colored from a mine waste spill.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that a cleanup... (Associated Press) \n \n Officials emphasized that there was no threat to drinking water from the spill. But downstream water agencies were warned to avoid Animas River water until the plume passes, said David Ostrander, director of the EPA's emergency response program in Denver. \n \n The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that a cleanup team was working with heavy equipment Wednesday to secure an entrance to the Gold King Mine in southwest Colorado. Workers instead released an estimated 1 million gallons of mine waste into Cement Creek. \n \n \"The project was intended to pump and treat the water and reduce metals pollution flowing out of the mine,\" agency spokesman Rich Mylott said in a statement. \n \n The creek runs into the Animas, which then flows into the San Juan River in New Mexico and joins the Colorado River in Utah. \n \n Officials weren't sure how long it would take the plume to dissipate, Ostrander said. The acidic sludge is made of heavy metal and soil, which could irritate the skin, he said. \n \n The EPA was testing the plume to see which metals were released. Previous contamination from the mine sent iron, aluminum, cadmium, zinc and copper into the water, said Peter Butler, co-coordinator of the Animas River Stakeholders Group. \n \n Earlier Thursday, the EPA said in a statement that the polluted water \"was held behind unconsolidated debris near an abandoned mine portal.\" \n \n As the plume headed toward New Mexico, that state's governor said the EPA waited too long to tell her about the problem. \n \n Gov. Susana Martinez is disturbed by the lack of information provided by the agency to New Mexico's environmental agencies, said Chris Sanchez, a spokesman for the governor. Sanchez said that the state was not told of the spill until almost a full day after it happened. \n \n The plume made its way to Durango on Thursday afternoon, prompting La Plata County health officials to warn rafters and others to avoid the water. The scenic waterway was the backdrop for parts of the movie \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and is popular with summer boaters. \n \n Durango stopped pumping water out of the Animas River on Wednesday to make sure none of the waste could be sucked up into the city reservoir. It also suspended the transfers of raw water to a local golf course and Fort Lewis College. Pet owners were advised to keep dogs and livestock out of the Animas. \n \n \"It's really, really ugly,\" Butch Knowlton, La Plata County's director of emergency preparedness, told The Durango Herald. \"Any kind of recreational activity on the river needs to be suspended.\" \n \n In Farmington, New Mexico, city officials shut down water-supply intake pumps to avoid contamination and advised citizens to stay out of the river until the discoloration has passed. Don Cooper, emergency manager in San Juan County, said people should not panic because the EPA had told the county the spill would not harm people and that the primary pollutants were iron and zinc. \n \n \"It's not going to look pretty, but it's not a killer,\" Cooper told The (Farmington) Daily Times. \n \n The impact on wildlife wasn't clear. There are no fish in the Cement Creek watershed because of longstanding problems with water quality, the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment said. \n \n Colorado Parks and Wildlife was placing cages containing fish in the Animas River to monitor what happens to them, spokesman Joe Lewandowski said. \n \n \"We'll see if those fish survive,\" Lewandowski said. \"We're also monitoring to make sure we don't get infiltration into the hatchery, because that could be a problem.\" \n \n The U.S. Fish & Wildlife office in suburban Denver did not immediately return a call asking about the spill. \n \n Durango resident Lisa Shaefer said she was near the mine Wednesday when a mine bulwark broke and sent a torrent of water downstream that raised the water level 2 to 3 feet in Cement Creek. The initial wall of water carried rocks and debris and made a roar as it pushed through a culvert, she said. \n \n \"What came down was the filthiest yellow mustard water you've ever seen,\" she told the newspaper. \n \n ___ \n \n Information from: KIQX-FM, http://www.radiodurango.com ||||| About 1 million gallons of mine waste spilled into a Colorado waterway on Wednesday, turning the water bright orange and prompting officials to warn residents to avoid recreational use of the Animas River. \n \n San Juan County health officials say the Environmental Protection Agency and the state Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety were investigating another contamination when they \u201cunexpectedly triggered a large release of mine waste water into the upper portions of Cement Creek.\u201d Cement Creek is a tributary of the Animas River. \n \n Residents in parts of Colorado have been urged to cut back on water use and avoid the Animas River until officials are sure the river is free from contamination.

Officials have placed cages of fish in the river to identify any ill effects and are testing the water to identify the specific metals released. An expert guesses the water contains high concentrations of iron, aluminum, cadmium, zinc, and copper, based on previous contamination.

        "Document": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) \u2013 A Trader Joe\u2019s store assistant manager was killed by gunfire from Los Angeles police officers during a chase and shootout with a suspect in Silver Lake Saturday. \n \n LAPD Chief Michel Moore told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that investigators have determined that one of two officers accidentally shot 27-year-old Melyda Corado while engaging in a shootout with the suspect, 28-year-old Gene Evin Atkins. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry to report that we\u2019ve now determined through our forensic investigation, that one of the officers\u2019 rounds struck Ms. Corado as she was exiting the market and was in close proximity to Atkins,\u201d Moore said. \u201cMs. Corado ran back into the store and collapsed behind the manager\u2019s desk.\u201d \n \n According to Moore, Atkins\u2019 car had slammed into a light pole outside the entrance of the Trader Joe\u2019s, located in the 2700 block of Hyperion Avenue. \n \n Upon hearing the crash, Corado was one of several people who ran to the front door of the store, at the same time that an armed Akins himself ran towards the entrance. \n \n \u201cAs he did so, witness statements and physical evidence from the scene support that Atkins fired multiple rounds from a semiautomatic pistol at the officers,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThe two Los Angeles police officers who had been pursuing Atkins returned fire in defense of their lives and to protect Atkins from harming other individuals.\u201d \n \n The officers fired eight rounds in returning Atkins\u2019 gunshots, Moore said. \n \n The fatal bullet first hit Corado\u2019s arm, then entered her body. \n \n Atkins appeared in court Tuesday to face more than 30 charges, including one count of murder, six counts of attempted murder, 13 counts of false imprisonment of hostages and one count of felony evading. His arraignment was postponed to Aug. 14. His bail was set at $18.7 million. \n \n The slaying is attributed to Atkins even though he did not fire the fatal bullet because he is held to have caused the entire situation. \n \n Moore also released dash-cam video leading up to the chase. Watch it below. \n \n Before Saturday\u2019s shootout at Trader Joe\u2019s, Atkins allegedly shot and wounded his grandmother, who remains hospitalized, and 17-year-old girlfriend. He then led police on a chase, ending at the store. \n \n The Trader Joe\u2019s store remained closed Monday, while a memorial of signs and flowers in memory of Corado continued to grow outside the building. \n \n Although Atkins was booked on suspicion of murder, he could potentially face charges including attempted murder for the roughly 1:30 p.m. Saturday shooting of his 76-year-old grandmother \u2014 Mary Elizabeth Madison \u2014 in the home they shared in the 1600 block of East 32nd Street. Authorities said the woman was shot as many as seven times and remains hospitalized in critical condition. \n \n Atkins\u2019 cousin, Charleo Egland, said she didn\u2019t know exactly what prompted the shooting, but said the grandmother did not want Atkins\u2019 girlfriend in the home, and that likely led to a fight that ended with the shooting. \n \n Police said Atkins\u2019 girlfriend was also wounded in the shooting, and Atkins forced her into his grandmother\u2019s car then drove away with her in the passenger seat. \n \n Using a LoJack system, police traced the 2015 Toyota Camry sedan to the Hollywood area and gave chase, leading to Silver Lake, where Atkins crashed the Toyota into a power pole around 3:30 p.m. in front of the Trader Joe\u2019s supermarket, Moore said. \n \n Atkins got out of the car and ran into the store, firing toward officers as he ran, police said. \n \n A short time later, a woman now known to be Corado was seen being dragged away from the store\u2019s entryway and then unsuccessfully treated by paramedics trying to revive her. \n \n Moore said about 40 people were in the store when Atkins entered. As Atkins ran inside, employees and customers inside scrambled for cover. \n \n Some were seen escaping through a window toward the rear of the business and crawling down a ladder to safety. \n \n Police were also seen carrying several children away from the building. \n \n Atkins\u2019 girlfriend, who had been in the passenger seat of the Toyota when it crashed in front of the store, was taken to a hospital in fair condition. Fire officials described her as a 20-year-old woman. \n \n Police amassed outside the store, and around 5:30 p.m., at least three people who appeared to be customers came out of the store with their hands in the air \u2014 apparently hostages who were released or shoppers who had managed to elude the gunman. \n \n Atkins surrendered at about 6:30 p.m. He was taken to a hospital to be treated for a gunshot wound to his left arm. \n \n Margaret Stewart of the Los Angeles Fire Department said paramedics treated 10 people at the scene of the Trader Joe\u2019s, including Atkins, his girlfriend and Corado. A 12-year-old boy, a 41-year-old woman, a 70-year- old woman and an 81-year-old woman were hospitalized with minor injuries and listed in fair condition, Stewart said. Three other people were evaluated, but declined to be taken to hospitals. \n \n Moore returned to the crime scene Tuesday to be among the mourners. \n \n \u201cThis is about, frankly, an opportunity to pay some respects to a family and to a loss,\u201d Moore said, appearing to become emotional at times. \u201cThis young lady, by every description, had so much to live for, and to a father that has lost, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s (indescribable).\u201d \n \n Reaction to the revelation that officers had accidentally killed Corado was mixed. \n \n \u201cI kind of blame the police because they were shooting directly towards the store,\u201d nearby business owner Peter Hakopyan said. \n \n Hakopyan told CBS2 he knew Corado and witnessed the shootout. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a grocery, and there\u2019s people around,\u201d Hakopyan added. \u201cI would think the police would have more restraint.\u201d \n \n Still, some appreciated the precarious situation in which the officers found themselves. \n \n \u201cThe police did what they felt they had to do in the moment. They couldn\u2019t know,\u201d said longtime Silver Lake resident Miranda Birch. \u201cI think it\u2019s tragic, but I think it\u2019s a mistake to blame the police.\u201d \n \n A GoFundMe page set up to help cover Corado\u2019s funeral expenses had raised nearly $25,000 as of midday Monday. \n \n (\u00a92018 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

But a State Department official said that the fact the money wasn't transferred on Jan. 1 doesn't mean it was frozen. \"There are still deliberations taking place, and we have until mid January to decide what we are going to do,\u201d the official said. \n \n The Trump administration has frozen $125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, according to three Western diplomats who were informed of the move. They said the funding, one third of the annual U.S. donations to the agency, was supposed to be transferred by Jan. 1 but was withheld. \n \n The details: The diplomats, who asked to speak on conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the funding was frozen until the Trump administration finishes its review of U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. \n \n The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway \"in light of the Palestinians' recent conduct.\" \n \n The diplomats added that U.S. officials told U.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to $180 million, which amounts to half of the U.S. funding to UNRWA. \n \n The impact: The Western diplomats said freezing or cutting of such a big part of the U.S. funding would be catastrophic for the organization, would hamper its work and might lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. \n \n U.N. secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has spoken with senior U.S. official about the UNRWA funding and also consulted with foreign ministers from other donor countries, according to the diplomats. \n \n The Israeli security establishment and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories \u2014 the Israeli organization that oversees government activities in the West Bank and Gaza \u2014 are concerned about possible freezing or cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, fearing the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n \n \u201cThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is complicated enough and harming UNRWA funding will only make it more complicated,\" a senior Israeli security official told me. \n \n What we're hearing: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not enthusiastic about the cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, but is politically pressed by conservative ministers in his cabinet and by the fact he can't be more dovish on the Palestinian issue than President Trump. \n \n Officials in the prime minister's office told diplomats from several western countries that Israel does not object to the cutting of U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority, but prefers that the U.S. doesn't cut funding to UNRWA due to the fact it also serves Israeli security interests. \n \n A senior Israeli official told me Netanyahu is in touch with the White House on the UNRWA funding issue, and conveyed the message that Israel prefers \u201cgradual disengagement\" with UNRWA by the U.S. and not a big funding cut. \n \n The prime minister's office said in a statement: \"Netanyahu supports President Trump's critical attitude towards UNRWA and believes practical steps need to be taken in order to change the fact that UNRWA is being used to entrench the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it.\" ||||| This is the full text of the Articles of Impeachment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee on July 27, 1974. \n \n Note: The articles of impeachment were passed only by the Committee on the Judiciary. They were never voted on in the full House of Representatives. Nixon was not impeached. \n \n Article 1 RESOLVED, That Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanours, and that the following articles of impeachment to be exhibited to the Senate: ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT EXHIBITED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN THE NAME OF ITSELF AND OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AGAINST RICHARD M. NIXON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT OF ITS IMPEACHMENT AGAINST HIM FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS. ARTICLE 1 In his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his consitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice, in that: On June 17, 1972, and prior thereto, agents of the Committee for the Re-election of the President committed unlawful entry of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, District of Columbia, for the purpose of securing political intelligence. Subsequent thereto, Richard M. Nixon, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede, and obstruct the investigation of such illegal entry; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities. The means used to implement this course of conduct or plan included one or more of the following: making false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; withholding relevant and material evidence or information from lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counselling witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings; interfering or endeavouring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, and Congressional Committees; approving, condoning, and acquiescing in, the surreptitious payment of substantial sums of money for the purpose of obtaining the silence or influencing the testimony of witnesses, potential witnesses or individuals who participated in such unlawful entry and other illegal activities; endeavouring to misuse the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency of the United States; disseminating information received from officers of the Department of Justice of the United States to subjects of investigations conducted by lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, for the purpose of aiding and assisting such subjects in their attempts to avoid criminal liability; making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted with respect to allegations of misconduct on the part of personnel of the executive branch of the United States and personnel of the Committee for the Re-election of the President, and that there was no involvement of such personnel in such misconduct: or endeavouring to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favoured treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony. In all of this, Richard M. Nixon has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore Richard M. Nixon, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office. Adopted 27-11 by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, at 7.07pm on Saturday, 27th July, 1974, in Room 2141 of the Rayburn Office Building, Washington D.C. Listen to the roll call of the Judiciary Committee on the First Article of Impeachment: \n \n \n \n Listen to the Announcement of the Vote: \n \n \n \n Article 2 Using the powers of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purposed of these agencies. This conduct has included one or more of the following: He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavoured to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposed not authorized by law, and to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be intitiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner. He misused the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, and other executive personnel, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, by directing or authorizing such agencies or personnel to conduct or continue electronic surveillance or other investigations for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; he did direct, authorize, or permit the use of information obtained thereby for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; and he did direct the concealment of certain records made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of electronic surveillance. He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, authorized and permitted to be maintained a secret investigative unit within the office of the President, financed in part with money derived from campaign contributions, which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged in covert and unlawful activities, and attempted to prejudice the constitutional right of an accused to a fair trial. He has failed to take care that the laws were faithfully executed by failing to act when he knew or had reason to know that his close subordinates endeavoured to impede and frustrate lawful inquiries by duly constituted executive, judicial and legislative entities concerning the unlawful entry into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, and the cover-up thereof, and concerning other unlawful activities including those relating to the confirmation of Richard Kleindienst as Attorney General of the United States, the electronic surveillance of private citizens, the break-in into the offices of Dr. Lewis Fielding, and the campaign financing practices of the Committee to Re-elect the President. In disregard of the rule of law, he knowingly misused the executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive branch, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Division, and the Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, of the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency, in violation of his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. In all of this, Richard M. Nixon has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore Richard M. Nixon, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.

He added that Trump \"has every right to express his view of any case.\" \n \n The latter comment refers to Trump's tweets dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. Most recently, Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser and campaign aide, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI, and one day later, Trump's Twitter account posted a comment that could help bolster a case of obstruction: \n \n \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\u201d Trump posted, the first time he suggested he knew Flynn lied to investigators. \n \n The tweet could be seen as evidence of obstruction of justice because Trump later reportedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to \u201clet\u201d the Flynn thing \u201cgo.\" \n \n Dowd said that he wrote the tweet. Not that it matters, because the president can't be found guilty of obstruction, the lawyer claims. \n \n It\u2019s not clear which section of the Constitution's Article II Dowd was referencing, though Section Two does read: \u201c The president] may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\u201d \n \n Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now \n \n But according to Dowd, the tweet was the furthest thing from an admission of guilt or obstruction. \n \n \"The tweet did not admit obstruction. That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion,\u201d Dowd told Axios. \n \n Dowd\u2019s comments hark back to former President Richard Nixon\u2019s defense of his actions in office. Nixon, who resigned in August 1974 before he could be impeached, famously said during his interviews with British journalist David Frost in 1977 that \u201cwhen the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\u201d \n \n REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan \n \n In Nixon\u2019s case, he was talking about the cover-up in the Watergate scandal, while Trump\u2019s case involves the president\u2019s powers over the Justice Department. Trump lamented in November that the \u201csaddest thing\u201d about being president is that he is \u201cnot supposed to be involved with the Justice Department\u201d and the \u201cFBI.\u201d \n \n Trump then asked why the Justice Department was not going after his former presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her private email server scandal. He also wondered why the department was not investigating Clinton\u2019s campaign for hiring the company that created the infamous Trump-Russia dossier that has dogged Trump\u2019s first year in office.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 The Trump attorney who says he penned the \"sloppy\" tweet that some say indicates a possible obstruction of justice isn't done making headlines. John Dowd spoke to Axios' Mike Allen, scoffing at criticism of the tweet regarding Mike Flynn, which suggested Trump knew the former national security adviser had lied to the FBI before Trump canned James Comey. \"The tweet did not admit obstruction,\" Dowd says. \"That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion.\" Plus, the Constitution has Trump's back, per Dowd. \"[The] president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution's Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,\" he claims. Newsweek notes it's not clear which section of Article II Dowd refers to, though it speculates on one part involving the president seeking the opinion \"of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\" Allen notes that with this pronouncement, Trump's legal team is \"setting the stage\" to keep Trump insulated from obstruction of justice or collusion charges in the Russia probe\u2014meaning, Allen speculates, that his lawyers may be nervous charges are coming down the pike. But one of Barack Obama's former counsels notes \"it is certainly possible\" for Trump to have obstructed justice, and Allen points out Richard Nixon's Articles of Impeachment were jump-started with the assertion that Nixon \"has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice.\" But whether Trump can or can't be held responsible for such a transgression may be moot, Allen adds. \"The one thing everyone agrees on is that the House of Representatives, with its impeachment power, alone decides what is cause for removal from office,\" he writes. \"For now, at least, the House is run by Republicans.\""

        "Document": "404 Not found \n \n \u2014 Police are asking property owners in this city and throughout nearby rural Albemarle County to look for any signs of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, hoping that they can locate her after nearly two weeks of searching. \n \n Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy J. Longo said during a news conference Thursday that searchers have combed through most of this college town and are now moving south into surrounding farms and woodland. He also urged real estate agents and others to look in and around vacant homes and buildings in an effort to find the 18-year-old, who has been missing since Sept. 13. \n \n Longo said Graham had an iPhone 5S with a pink case that has not been found, and he said people should report anything they see that seems out of the ordinary on their properties, including unexpected tire tracks, clothing or other evidence that might help police find her. \n \n \u201cWe have no idea where she is, despite our best efforts,\u201d Longo said. \u201cEveryone realizes the more time that goes by, the more difficult this is going to come for everyone. I can\u2019t lose hope until I have to, until I need to, until it\u2019s appropriate to transition this into some other type of operation. I have hope, and I think Hannah\u2019s mom and dad have hope.\u201d \n \n Longo said in an interview Thursday that he wants anyone who knows Jesse L. \u201cLJ\u201d Matthew Jr., 32, who is charged with abducting Graham, to help identify spots that Matthew frequented. Police asked for help finding \u00adplaces where Matthew likes to fish, for example. A reward of $100,000 is being offered for information leading to the safe return of the 18-year-old U-Va. sophomore from Fairfax County. \n \n Charlottesville investigators arrived Thursday in Galveston, Tex., where Matthew appeared in court after he was arrested on a beach Wednesday afternoon. Longo said Charlottesville police will not approach Matthew about the case because he has invoked his right to consult with an attorney. Local authorities said they would try to speak with him late Thursday or early Friday, and they were searching his car for evidence. \n \n Matthew is the last person known to have seen Graham, and he has been charged with abduction with intent to sexually assault her. Police have not detailed what evidence they have against him. Matthew was taken into custody Wednesday in Texas after a widespread manhunt, and police said he will be extradited to Charlottesville to face charges in her disappearance. \n \n Early Thursday, Matthew appeared briefly in a Texas courtroom, where a judge denied bond and read Matthew his rights. Matthew declined a court- \n \n appointed attorney and waived an extradition hearing. \n \n Charlottesville lawyer James L. Camblos III, who is representing Matthew, said that he spoke to Matthew by phone late Wednesday, after his arrest. \n \n \u201cHe sounded okay considering the circumstances,\u201d Camblos said. \u201cHe called me from the jail and, under the circumstances, he sounded pretty good.\u201d \n \n Longo said it is unclear why Matthew was in the Galveston area, a popular summer destination on the Gulf of Mexico southeast of Houston and about 1,300 miles from Charlottesville. A Galveston County deputy found Matthew after the sheriff\u2019s office received a call from a woman who saw Matthew on the beach \u2014 in Gilchrist, on the Bolivar Peninsula \u2014 and found him suspicious. \n \n The deputy noticed that Matthew had set up a tent on the beach, sheriff\u2019s Capt. Barry Cook said. Matthew initially gave a false name, but the deputy ran the license plates on Matthew\u2019s car and discovered that he was wanted in Virginia, Cook said. Matthew was taken into custody without incident. \n \n [See a map of the region where Matthew was apprehended.] \n \n Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset said Thursday that deputies have examined the car and surrounding sand dunes and will widen their search, but that they have no indication of where Graham might be. \n \n \u201cThis individual has a 1,300-mile track,\u201d the sheriff said, referring to Matthew\u2019s trip from Charlottesville to east Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of area to look at.\u201d \n \n It is unclear what ties, if any, Matthew might have to Texas. He grew up in the Charlottesville area and attended two Virginia universities \u2014 Liberty from 2000 to 2002 and then Christopher Newport in 2003. He played football at both schools and left both schools. Officials at the school would not discuss the circumstances of his departure, citing privacy rules. \n \n Also on Thursday, the owner of the restaurant where Graham was last seen said that Graham never entered the establishment with her alleged abductor, instead waiting outside for him while he purchased drinks. \n \n Brice Cunningham, owner of the upscale Tempo Restaurant in Charlottesville, said he saw Matthew for the first time at the restaurant late on Friday, Sept. 12, and then again during the early hours of Sept. 13. Cunningham said that Matthew drank shots of bourbon with two other customers about 11:45 p.m., and that he then saw Matthew enjoying music on the restaurant\u2019s dance floor. \n \n Cunningham said that Matthew, who was not a regular at the bar, appeared to be having a good time that evening. \n \n \u201cHe wasn\u2019t aggressive, he wasn\u2019t unpleasant,\u201d said Cunningham, 43. \u201cHe seemed friendly and was talking to people.\u201d \n \n Cunningham said that Matthew left the bar briefly and returned just after 1 a.m., closed a tab for two beers at 1:10 a.m. and then left sometime after that. He said that Tempo staffers, who were checking identification to ensure that patrons were at least 21 years old, saw Graham outside the bar and thought she appeared intoxicated. They saw her leave with Matthew on foot. \n \n \u201cNone of my staff saw her inside that night,\u201d Cunningham said in an interview Thursday. In a statement, Cunningham said that Graham was not served alcohol. \u201cShe was, however, noticed by the door person outside the restaurant at that time, and seen leaving with Matthew shortly thereafter.\u201d \n \n Graham had been seen on surveillance video walking with Matthew shortly after 1 a.m. on the city\u2019s Downtown Mall, headed in the direction of Tempo. Friends said her last text to them was at 1:06 a.m., just minutes before Matthew got to Tempo. The owner\u2019s account suggests that Graham arrived at the restaurant with Matthew, waited for him outside, and then left with him. \n \n The account differs from what police have said about Graham\u2019s interactions with Matthew at Tempo. Longo said Thursday that his investigators \u201chave at least one witness statement that puts Hannah Graham inside the bar with Mr. Matthew. You\u2019re always evaluating witness statements in an ongoing investigation, and we will be talking to folks again, but we have that statement.\u201d \n \n An extensive search has turned up almost no trace of Graham after she was seen at Tempo. Police have collected evidence from Matthew\u2019s car and apartment, and Longo said that prosecutors decided to press charges against Matthew after reviewing evidence from experts at the crime lab in Richmond. The charge against Matthew suggests that police believe Matthew took Graham against her will \u2014 or while she was in a state that left her unable to consent. \n \n Those close to Matthew, who is 6-foot-2 and weighs 270 pounds, have said they know him as a \u201cgentle giant\u201d who prayed at a local church, worked at the U-Va. hospital caring for patients and volunteered at the private Covenant School as a football coach. \n \n Flaherty and Jouvenal reported from Washington. ||||| Thank you for Reading. \n \n Please purchase a subscription to continue reading. \n \n A subscription is required to continue reading. \n \n Thank you for reading 5 free articles.

(Associated Press) \n \n Jill Howard, left, and her stepdaughter Martie Belt, talk about the arrest of Leroy Matthew Jr. as they walk along the beach Thursday, Sept. 25, 2014, near Gilchrist, Texas, on the Bolivar Peninsula.... (Associated Press) \n \n The island's beaches have served as a hiding spot for centuries: graves from one of the Houston area's most notorious mass slayings and a haven for the famed French pirate Jean Lafitte. \n \n \"We seem to be the end of the road,\" Sheriff Henry Trochesset said. \n \n Matthew was arrested Wednesday as a suspect in the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham. He waived extradition Thursday in Galveston. \n \n His arrest \u2014 initially for refusing to identify himself to authorities \u2014 came after a phone tip from a resident who saw the 6-foot-2, 270-pound man with dreadlocks and recognized him from TV. A deputy then spotted him camped out on the beach. \n \n It's not uncommon to see random tents on the barren beaches, nor for sheriff's deputies to encounter people who don't want to identify themselves, Trochesset said. \n \n \"We get lots of weird folks,\" Rob Faupel, 45, an air conditioning technician, said. \"It seems like a good place to seek refuge. It's kind of remote.\" \n \n Only one road leads to the peninsula from the mainland to the east, a two-lane state highway south of Interstate 10 that ends at the Gulf of Mexico and heads west toward Galveston. Repeated storms wiped out the old highway Texas 87 that bordered the seashore and led to Port Arthur and Beaumont at the far southeast corner of the state. Motorists coming from Galveston and Houston must take a 20-minute ferry ride across Galveston Bay. \n \n As far as the campers, beach maintenance crew member Cliff Reichel said, \"We don't bother them unless they flat out are doing something wrong.\" \n \n Reichel, 62, of Galveston, recalled one woman who was noteworthy because she had puppets on stakes outside her tent. She stayed for five months, then abruptly left. \n \n \"You get people who stay a month at a time, a week at a time,\" his partner, Jacob Huffstetler, 25, of nearby High Island, added. \n \n Becky Sosa, who works at Miss Nancy's Bait Camp in Gilchrist not far from the beach, agreed that Matthew might have easily gone unnoticed. \n \n \"He would fit right in,\" said the 54-year-old Sosa. \"We get some strange ones that come through here.

His 28-victim killing spree ended when accomplice Elmer Wayne Henley Jr. killed him in August 1973. \n \n \"It's kind of scary,\" Jill Howard, 56, of Arlington, said, recalling the infamous killings while walking the beach Thursday with her stepdaughter. But she said she could understand how someone trying to avoid capture would head out to \"this beach out in the boonies.\"",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Jesse Matthew, charged with the abduction of missing UVa student Hannah Graham, was found in Galveston, Texas, Wednesday on a \"beach out in the boonies,\" as one Texan put it. After a tip, police spotted Matthew camped out on a sliver of sand on the remote Bolivar Peninsula\u2014the site of a mass grave used decades ago by serial killer Dean Corll and accessible by a single road, the AP reports. Matthew is one of many to hole up on the spot (among others: famed French pirate Jean Lafitte, rumor has it), where some stay for months. \"We get lots of weird folks,\" says a local. \"It seems like a good place to seek refuge. It's kind of remote.\" More on the case from the Washington Post and the Daily Progress: Matthew initially said he was \"George Carr,\" but police discovered his true identity when they ran his car's plates. Authorities have searched the car, beach, and sand dunes. The case has brought to light another accusation against Matthew. An official has confirmed he was accused of raping a woman at Liberty University in 2002, but she didn't proceed with the case. He was a student there at the time. \"Basically, the woman was saying she hadn't consented and Matthew was saying she had,\" says an attorney with the Lynchburg Commonwealth Attorney's Office. Searchers have scoured much of Charlottesville, Va., and are moving on to surrounding farms and woodland. They've asked area real estate agents to inspect any vacant buildings or properties they represent, and have told the public to be on the lookout for Graham's iPhone 5S with a pink case or unexplained tire tracks. Authorities are also looking to identify some of Matthew's favorite fishing spots. Matthew has declined to fight his extradition, and Virginia police have been sent to retrieve him. He should arrive back in Charlottesville in a few days."

        "Document": "Ladies rock outer space! \n \n \n \n Women have played critical roles throughout the history of the U.S. space program, a.k.a. NASA or the National Aeronautics and Space Administration. Yet in many cases, their contributions are unknown or under-appreciated \u2014 especially as women have historically struggled to gain acceptance in the fields of science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM). \n \n \n \n This proposed set celebrates five notable NASA pioneers and provides an educational building experience to help young ones and adults alike learn about the history of women in STEM. The five Women of NASA are: ||||| For years, Maia Weinstock, the deputy editor of MIT News, has been creating miniature LEGO figurines to honor and promote such scientists and engineers as MIT Institute Professor Emerita Mildred Dresselhaus, Vice President for Research Maria T. Zuber, and Department of Chemical Engineering head Paula Hammond, the David H. Koch Chair Professor in Engineering. The figures are Weinstock\u2019s playful way of boosting the visibility of scientists, in particular the work of female scientists. \n \n Now, a set of LEGOs Weinstock created celebrating the history of women at NASA is about to blast off. On Tuesday, LEGO announced that Weinstock\u2019s project, which spotlights five women who made historic contributions to the U.S. space program, has been selected to become an official LEGO set. \n \n \u201cWhat a wonderful way to celebrate the scientific achievements of these five pioneering women,\ufffd? says Zuber, the E.A. Griswold Professor of Geophysics and the first woman to lead a NASA planetary mission. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thrilled with the message that these LEGOs will send to girls \u2014 that they, too, can pursue their passions in science, technology, engineering, and math, and help make a better world.\ufffd? \n \n Last summer Weinstock submitted her concept, dubbed the Women of NASA, to LEGO Ideas, a platform that allows people around the world to propose new ideas for LEGO concepts. After a public voting period, during which Weinstock\u2019s set received 10,000 votes in 15 days, her project underwent an official LEGO review. \n \n Weinstock was inspired to create the set by her love of space and NASA, and her desire to showcase the contributions that women have made over the years to the field of space exploration. Above all, she hopes the set will help encourage more young girls to pursue STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math). \n \n \u201cI hope that \u2018Women of NASA\u2019 will be one little extra brick in the wall of trying to improve how women are perceived and shown in books, toys, and family programming,\ufffd? Weinstock explains. \u201cAnything I can do to help make sure girls understand that they can and should be interested in the sciences, engineering, and math, that is my goal. At the end of the day, that\u2019s why I am doing this.\ufffd? \n \n The set depicts five trailblazers in NASA\u2019s history: Margaret Hamilton, a computer scientist who led the development of software for the Apollo missions while at MIT; Mae Jemison, who became the first African-American woman in space in 1992; Katherine Johnson, known for calculating and verifying trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo programs; Sally Ride, who became the first American woman in space in 1983; and astronomer Nancy Grace Roman, one of the first female executives at NASA, who was instrumental in the planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. \n \n Weinstock explains that she wanted the set to feature \u201ca very diverse group of women in terms of what they did, in terms of their fields at NASA, in terms of their cultural backgrounds, and also in terms of their age. Some are shown as younger, but I made sure I had one shown as older. Also, most of the women in the set are known for their work in the space flight program at NASA, but I wanted to give a shout out to the astronomy program as well.\ufffd? \n \n Weinstock began creating LEGO figures back in 2009, when she constructed a LEGO likeness for her friend Carolyn Porco, a planetary scientist known for her imaging work on the Voyager and Cassini missions. After sharing an image of Porco\u2019s LEGO figurine on Twitter, Weinstock received an outpouring of positive feedback and was inspired to create more figures in an effort to help promote the work of living scientists. \n \n Since she built her first figurine, Weinstock has created LEGOs for a number of celebrated scientists and engineers, including primatologist Jane Goodall, oceanographer Sylvia Earle, physicist Stephen Hawking, and a number of MIT faculty members such as Ernest Moniz, professor of physics and special advisor to the president, and Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a member of MIT\u2019s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. \n \n \u201cBeing immortalized in LEGO is probably the coolest thing that has ever happened to me,\ufffd? Bhatia says. \u201cI hope it makes lots of little tinkerers dream about being engineers at MIT someday.\ufffd? \n \n Weinstock explains that she chose LEGOs as her medium as she feels \u201cthere is a childlike wonder to playing with a toy that you can make in people\u2019s likeness.\ufffd? \n \n \u201cOne major goal for me is to get the public to recognize the history of women in the STEM fields. I\u2019m hopeful that with this set more people will come to know these women,\ufffd? Weinstock says. \u201cPart of it is knowing these specific five women, but also part of it is setting an example. It\u2019s really important to set an example for girls, as well as for boys, to normalize and make plain that women are expected to be in these fields and that it\u2019s not strange or unusual.\ufffd?",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Mathematician Katherine Johnson was one of the women of NASA depicted in the Oscar-nominated film Hidden Figures, and now she's about to get her own Lego figure.

Concepts for potential sets can be posted on the site, and after the public votes (Weinstock, the deputy editor of MIT News, got 10,000 votes for her idea), Lego then reviews eligible projects. Weinstock says she not only wanted to give a nod to the history of women in STEM, but also to \"set an example\" for both girls and boys that it isn't \"strange or unusual\" for there to be females working as astronauts, computer programmers, or any other science or technology expert. Lego says more details on Weinstock's set, including how much it will cost and its release date, should be out later this year or in early 2018. (Cambridge is offering a Lego professorship.)"

Really not,\" said Cassavetes. \"And Ryan came to me, and there's 150 people standing in this big scene, and he says, 'Nick, come here.' And he's doing a scene with Rachel and he says, 'Would you take her out of here and bring in another actress to read off-camera with me?' I said, 'What?' He says, 'I can't. I can't do it with her. I'm just not getting anything from this.\" \n \n Apparently, the only thing that calmed the feud between the lead actors was more fighting. \n \n \"We went into a room with a producer; they started screaming and yelling at each other. I walked out,\" Cassavetes recalled. \"At that point I was smoking cigarettes. I smoked a cigarette and everybody came out like, 'All right, let's do this.' And it got better after that, you know?

(Associated Press) \n \n MUNICH (AP) \u2014 Russia has proposed a March 1 ceasefire in Syria, U.S. officials say, but Washington believes Moscow is giving itself and the Syrian government three weeks to try to crush moderate rebel groups. \n \n The United States has countered with demands for the fighting to stop immediately, the officials said Wednesday. Peace talks are supposed to resume by Feb. 25. \n \n The talk of new ceasefire plans comes as the U.S., Russia and more than a dozen other countries meet in Munich to try to halt five years of civil war in the Arab country. The conflict has killed more than a quarter-million people, created Europe's biggest refugee crisis since World War II and allowed the Islamic State to carve out its own territory across parts of Syria and neighboring Iraq. \n \n Russia says it is supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad's government as part of a counterterrorism campaign. But the West says the majority of its strikes are targeting moderate groups that are opposed to Assad and the Islamic State. \n \n The most recent Russian-backed offensive, near Aleppo, prompted opposition groups to walk out of peace talks last month in Geneva, while forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee toward the Turkish border. \n \n The U.S. officials weren't authorized to speak publicly about private diplomatic discussions in the run-up to the Munich conference and demanded anonymity. One said the U.S. can't accept Russia's offer because opposition forces could suffer irreversible losses in northern and southern Syria before the ceasefire ever takes hold. \n \n The officials said the U.S. counterproposal is simple: A ceasefire that is effective immediately and is accompanied by full humanitarian access to Syria's besieged civilian centers. \n \n Secretary of State John Kerry, who arrived in Germany Wednesday, had talks planned late in the evening with U.N. peace envoy Staffan de Mistura and Adel al-Jubeir, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, a key backer of Syria's rebel groups. \n \n The Obama administration has been trying for months to clinch a ceasefire and pave the way for a transition government in Syria that would allow parties to the conflict to concentrate on defeating the threat posed by the Islamic State and the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front. \n \n But after having long demanded Assad's ouster, the shift in the U.S. focus to combating terrorism has resulted in a confusing mix of priorities and a layered strategy in Syria that few understand, and even fewer see working. Beyond Russia, the administration has often struggled to keep its own allies such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia in line. \n \n \"We will approach this meeting in Munich with great hopes that this will be a telling moment,\" Kerry said Tuesday in Washington. His peace push coincides with Defense Secretary Ash Carter's attendance at a gathering in Brussels to hash out military options with NATO partners. \n \n Brett McGurk, the Obama administration's point-man for defeating the Islamic State, said Russia's Aleppo offensive was having the perverse effect of helping the extremists by drawing local fighters away from the battle against IS and to the war against Syria's government. \n \n \"What Russia's doing is directly enabling ISIL,\" McGurk told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in Washington. \n \n But the panel's top Democrat echoed some of the frustration of his Republican colleagues with the larger U.S. strategy. \n \n \"It seems as if we're only halfheartedly going after ISIS, and halfheartedly helping the (rebel) Free Syria Army and others on the ground,\" said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. He urged a \"robust campaign, not a tentative one, not one that seems like we're dragging ourselves in ... to destroy ISIS and get rid of Assad.\" \n \n Kerry emphasized Tuesday that U.S. officials \"are not blind to what is happening.\" He said the Aleppo battle makes it \"much more difficult to be able to come to the table and to be able to have a serious conversation.\" \n \n But the U.S. has staked its hopes for an end to the five-year civil war in Syria on the peace talks and Assad's eventual departure, saying the American public has no appetite for a military solution. \n \n To that end, Washington has tempered its calls dating back to August 2011 for Assad to immediately leave power. And to get Russia on board, it now won't even say that Assad should be barred from running for re-election if and when a new Syrian constitution is drafted. \n \n The ambiguity has emboldened Assad's supporters, Russia and Iran, while upsetting American allies in the Middle East, who are frustrated by a process that appears to lock the Syrian leader in place well into 2017 \u2014 and perhaps beyond.",

The most recent Russian-backed offensive, near Aleppo, prompted opposition groups to walk out of peace talks last month in Geneva, while forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee toward the Turkish border. Sources tell the AP that the US can't accept Russia's offer of a March 1 ceasefire because moderate opposition forces could suffer irreversible losses in northern and southern Syria before it ever takes hold. Defense Secretary Ash Carter, meanwhile, says NATO military authorities have been ordered to draw up plans for how the alliance could help shut down illegal migration and people smuggling across the Aegean Sea. Three NATO allies\u2014Turkey, Germany, and Greece\u2014requested alliance participation in an international effort to help end Europe's gravest migration crisis since World War II."

        "Document": "Photo Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n Last week\u2019s major chemical spill into West Virginia\u2019s Elk River, which cut off water to more than 300,000 people, came in a state with a long and troubled history of regulating the coal and chemical companies that form the heart of its economy. \n \n \u201cWe can\u2019t just point a single finger at this company,\u201d said Angela Rosser, the executive director of West Virginia Rivers Coalition. \u201cWe need to look at our entire system and give some serious thought to making some serious reform and valuing our natural resources over industry interests.\u201d \n \n She said lawmakers have yet to explain why the storage facility was allowed to sit on the river and so close to a water treatment plant that is the largest in the state. \n \n Ms. Rosser and others noted that the site of the spill has not been subject to a state or federal inspection since 1991. West Virginia law does not require inspections for chemical storage facilities \u2014 only for production facilities. \n \n Some other states do require inspections of chemical storage facilities. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said he was working with Randy Huffman, the secretary of the State Department of Environmental Protection, to come up with recommendations aimed at avoiding future leaks. \n \n The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported Sunday that a team of experts from the United States Chemical Safety Board asked the state three years ago to create a new program to prevent accidents and releases in the Kanawha Valley, known as Chemical Valley. \n \n That came after investigation of the August 2008 explosion and fire that killed two workers at the Bayer CropScience plant in Institute, W.Va. No program was produced, and another team from the same board is expected to arrive Monday to investigate this accident. \n \n Critics say the problems are widespread in a state where the coal and chemical industries, which drive much of West Virginia\u2019s economy and are powerful forces in the state\u2019s politics, have long pushed back against tight federal health, safety and environmental controls. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cWest Virginia has a pattern of resisting federal oversight and what they consider E.P.A. interference, and that really puts workers and the population at risk,\u201d said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a lecturer in environmental health at George Washington University. \n \n But Mr. Huffman disputed that accusation, noting that West Virginia\u2019s economy is more heavily dependent than other states on the coal and chemical industries. \u201cBased upon the types of industrial activity, how does it compare to the rest of the country? It\u2019s not in context.\u201d Although he added, \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse for any incident where someone gets hurt.\u201d \n \n Efforts to clean up the spill showed signs of improvement on Sunday. \n \n \u201cThe numbers look good, and like last night, they are very encouraging,\u201d Governor Tomblin said in a news conference on Sunday. \u201cI believe we\u2019re at a point where we can say we\u2019re seeing light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d \n \n Officials said tests conducted at a water treatment plant downstream from the site of the leak showed little to no traces of contamination on Sunday morning, allowing testing to move to the next phase. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Once the testing is complete, the water company plans to begin lifting the do-not-use ban by zones. The work will start in downtown Charleston and three other \u201cpriority zones\u201d that include the city\u2019s four major hospitals and 25,000 customers who use more than half of the company\u2019s water, said Jeff McIntyre, the president of West Virginia American Water. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re several days from starting the lift, but I\u2019m saying not today,\u201d Mr. McIntyre said. \n \n Government offices and many businesses planned to reopen on Monday, while many schools in the affected areas would remain closed, officials said. \n \n \u201cStores are open,\u201d said Jimmy Gianato, the state director of homeland security. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get back to normal.\u201d \n \n Emergency rooms have treated about 169 patients for symptoms related to chemical exposure, said Karen Bowling, the state health secretary. Ten people were admitted to three hospitals with symptoms that were not life threatening, she said. \n \n The chemical in last Thursday\u2019s spill was 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM. The leak at the Elk River storage facility came from a ruptured tank storing this chemical, which is used to wash coal. \n \n No charges have been filed against Freedom Industries, the company that owns the plant, but the United States attorney\u2019s office has already begun an investigation into the spill. \n \n \u201cWhenever you have a discharge of a pollutant or a hazardous substance you have potential violation of the environmental laws,\u201d said Booth Goodwin, the United States attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, according to a news report on WVVA.com. \n \n This is not the first chemical accident to hit West Virginia\u2019s Kanawha Valley. \n \n After an explosion at a West Virginia chemical plant owned by Bayer CropScience killed two employees in 2008, a 2010 congressional investigation found that managers refused for several hours to tell emergency responders the nature of the blast or the toxic chemical it released. It also found that they later misused a law intended to keep information from terrorists to try to stop federal investigators from learning what had happened. The plant manufactured the same chemical that was being processed at the time of a gas release in 1984 that killed 10,000 in Bhopal, India. \n \n West Virginia is also no stranger to accidents in the coal industry. \n \n In 2012, federal prosecutors charged David C. Hughart, a top executive at Massey Energy, a West Virginia coal operator, with a felony count and a second misdemeanor conspiracy count related to the deaths of 29 coal miners in a 2009 explosion at West Virginia\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine. Prosecutors said that Mr. Hughart and others knowingly conspired to violate safety laws at Massey\u2019s mines and worked to hide those violations by giving advance warnings of surprise inspections by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. \n \n In 2009, an investigation by The New York Times found that hundreds of workplaces in West Virginia had violated pollution laws without paying fines. In interviews at the time, current and former West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection employees said their enforcement efforts had been undermined by bureaucratic disorganization; a departmental preference to let polluters escape punishment if they promised to try harder; and a revolving door of regulators who left for higher-paying jobs at the companies they once policed. \n \n In June 2009, four environmental groups petitioned the E.P.A. to take over much of West Virginia\u2019s handling of the Clean Water Act, citing a \u201cnearly complete breakdown\u201d in the state. \n \n \u201cHistorically, there had been a questionable enforcement ethic,\u201d said Matthew Crum, a former state mining director at the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection. \n \n Cindy Rank, chairwoman of the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy\u2019s mining committee, said that the coal lobby has wielded great influence in crafting state environmental regulations. \u201cAccidents are always preventable. For the most part I think that\u2019s true in these disasters that keep happening,\u201d she said. She recalled negotiations over a groundwater protection bill from the early 1990s. \u201cWe swallowed hard and allowed the coal industry to get away with a lot in that bill,\u201d she said. ||||| Hundreds of thousands of West Virginia residents have gone more than four days without clean tap water after a chemical spill, though officials say that chemical readouts are returning to safe levels. NBC's Anne Thompson reports. \n \n The latest tests of poisoned water in West Virginia have shown that the quality is improving \u201cin the right direction,\u201d the state\u2019s governor said Sunday \u2014 a hopeful sign for the 300,000 residents currently under a strict tap water ban following a chemical spill four days ago. \n \n \"We are at a point where we can see a light at the end of the tunnel,\" Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said at a news conference. \n \n But officials stopped short of saying when the do-not-use order would be lifted. \n \n \"I can tell you we\u2019re not several days from starting to lift, but I\u2019m not saying today,\" said Jeff McIntyre, president of West Virginia American Water, which runs the water treatment plant. \n \n The chemical spill first noticed Thursday on the Elk River has contaminated the water supply in the heart of the state, shutting down schools and businesses across nine counties, and forcing emergency agencies to truck in clean water to the Charleston region. \n \n Lt. Col. Greg Grant of the West Virginia National Guard said two tests Sunday morning at the treatment facility show the chemical\u2019s concentration at 0 parts-per-million for water going in and out of the plant. \n \n Before the all clear can be given once and for all, water sample test results must consistently show that the chemical\u2019s presence in the public water system is at or below 1 parts-per-million, the level recommended by federal agencies. \n \n \"That is a very encouraging and allows us to move forward\" with the next phase of sampling and testing, Grant said. \n \n Sixteen teams were collecting samples from affected areas in the region, and officials cautioned that the ban won\u2019t be lifted until results were in and the state health department signs off. Communities will be given the OK on a zone-by-zone basis. \n \n Marcus Constantino / The Daily Mail via AP Members of the West Virginia Army National Guard, along with a member of the Belle Police Department and a volunteer, offload emergency water from a military truck to a forklift as citizens line up Saturday for water at the Belle Fire Department in Belle, W.Va. \n \n West Virginia American Water is launching an online map to show which communities can begin using their tap water. The company will also autodial customers when the ban in their zone has been lifted. A hotline is also being made available to them. \n \n Schools will also be closed or partially closed in six counties Monday, although officials expect most students to be back in classrooms by Tuesday. \n \n The reliance on bottled water is taking its toll on frustrated residents who\u2019ve stripped stores and spent hours in long lines to collect water from tankers set up by the National Guard. Until the water is deemed safe, residents have been asked not to drink, bathe and cook with the tainted tap. \n \n The environmental emergency began Thursday morning, when the state Department of Environmental Protection began receiving complaints around 8:15 a.m. of a licorice-type odor in the tap water. It took three hours before officials found the source of the spill. \n \n The source turned out to be the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, which had leaked out of a 40,000-gallon tank at a Freedom Industries facility along the Elk River. \n \n Freedom Industries didn\u2019t report the leak to a spill hotline until 12:05 p.m. ET Thursday. \n \n State officials said Saturday they believe about 7,500 gallons leaked. Some of the chemical was contained before flowing into the river; it\u2019s not clear exactly how much entered the water supply. \n \n All told, 169 people have sought treatment at hospitals for symptoms such as nausea. Of those, 10 were admitted to three different hospitals, but their conditions weren\u2019t serious. \n \n Federal authorities, including the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, have opened an investigation into Thursday\u2019s spill. \n \n According to the state DEP, Freedom Industries is exempt from DEP inspections and permitting since it stores chemicals, and doesn\u2019t produce them. \n \n But the DEP ordered Freedom Industries to move its coal processing chemicals to a safer site and said it has 24 hours to start writing a plan on how it will clean up the spill and any soil contamination. \n \n The company did not take part in Sunday\u2019s news conference, and Gov. Tomblin said the state hasn\u2019t had much guidance from the company about the chemical in question. \n \n \"Perhaps they could have been a little bit more forthcoming to offer their assistance about what problems this particular chemical could cause,\" Tomblin said. \n \n Tomblin said he will work with his environmental agency chief on tightening regulation of chemical storage facilities in the current legislative session. \n \n Most visitors have cleared out of Charleston while locals are either staying home or driving out of the area to find a hot meal or a shower elsewhere. Orders not to use tap water for much other than flushing toilets mean that the spill is an emergency not just for the environment but for local businesses. \n \n Lisa Hechesky / Reuters Boats sit in the Elk River in front of the Freedom Industries plant in Charleston, W. Va., on Saturday. \n \n In downtown Charleston, the store Taylor Books usually fills the 40 seats in its cafe. But the cafe was shut down by the state Department of Health on Friday because it said employees had no way to safely wash their hands before serving customers. On Saturday only three people sat in the bookstore using the wireless Internet. \n \n Taylor Books' manager Dan Carlisle said he canceled a musician scheduled to play that night and the store was going to close five hours early. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s pretty annoying,\u201d Carlisle said about Freedom Industries\u2019 response to the spill. \u201cI feel like you should just be honest with people immediately.\u201d \n \n In a statement issued Friday, Freedom Industries said that it was working with government agencies to contain the leak, and \u201cthe first priority was safety, containment and cleanup.\u201d \n \n The chemical spill has forced West Virginia's residents to examine the state's reliance on the coal and chemical industries. \n \n Coal is critical to the economy. Strong coal prices and demand proved vital to the state budget during and after the national recession, from 2009 through 2011. \n \n In Gov. Tomblin's recent State-of-the-State speech, he touted the chemical industry, saying it was among those that grew substantially over the last year. \n \n The spill that tainted the water supply involved a chemical used in coal processing. But it didn't involve a coal mine \u2014 and that's a point state officials are trying to convey to the public. \n \n When asked if the emergency is one of the risks of being a state that relies heavily on the coal industry, Tomblin quickly responded: \"This was not a coal company incident, this was a chemical company incident.\" \n \n \"It's used in processing coal, as I understand it, but obviously it was not a coal company, it was a chemical company that left the breach and the tanks that's holding this particular chemical,\" he said. \n \n The coal industry, too, was saying they should not bear the blame in this case. \n \n \"This is a chemical spill accident. It just so happens that the chemical has some applications to the coal industry, just that fact alone shouldn't cause people to point fingers at the coal industry,\" said Jason Bostic, vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 The chemical spill that has left more than 300,000 people in West Virginia without water appears to be the product of lax regulation in a state where coal and chemical firms have long operated with little oversight, the New York Times finds. A document released over the weekend reveals state authorities were aware that the company responsible was storing up to a million pounds of the coal-cleaning chemical Crude MCHM at a riverside facility near a water treatment plant, but it's not clear whether the treatment plant knew about the risk, reports the Wall Street Journal. \"We can\u2019t just point a single finger at this company,\" says the director of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition, noting that the site of the spill hadn't been inspected since 1991. \"We need to look at our entire system and give some serious thought to making some serious reform and valuing our natural resources over industry interests.\" A tap water ban is still in place in the Charleston region, where many schools and businesses remain closed, but authorities say they can \"see the light at the end of the tunnel\" and they expect the ban to be lifted within days, starting in downtown Charleston and other priority zones, NBC reports."

        "Document": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the United States military prepares to leave Iraq by the end of 2011, the Obama administration is planning a remarkable civilian effort, buttressed by a small army of contractors, to fill the void. \n \n By October 2011, the State Department will assume responsibility for training the Iraqi police, a task that will largely be carried out by contractors. With no American soldiers to defuse sectarian tensions in northern Iraq, it will be up to American diplomats in two new $100 million outposts to head off potential confrontations between the Iraqi Army and Kurdish pesh merga forces. \n \n To protect the civilians in a country that is still home to insurgents with Al Qaeda and Iranian-backed militias, the State Department is planning to more than double its private security guards, up to as many as 7,000, according to administration officials who disclosed new details of the plan. Defending five fortified compounds across the country, the security contractors would operate radars to warn of enemy rocket attacks, search for roadside bombs, fly reconnaissance drones and even staff quick reaction forces to aid civilians in distress, the officials said. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think State has ever operated on its own, independent of the U.S. military, in an environment that is quite as threatening on such a large scale,\u201d said James Dobbins, a former ambassador who has seen his share of trouble spots as a special envoy for Afghanistan, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo and Somalia. \u201cIt is unprecedented in scale.\u201d \n \n White House officials expressed confidence that the transfer to civilians \u2014 about 2,400 people who would work at the Baghdad embassy and other diplomatic sites \u2014 would be carried out on schedule, and that they could fulfill their mission of helping bring stability to Iraq. \n \n \u201cThe really big picture that we have seen in Iraq over the last year and a half to two years is this: the number of violent incidents is significantly down, the competence of Iraqi security forces is significantly up, and politics has emerged as the basic way of doing business in Iraq,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, the national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R. Biden Jr. \u201cIf that trend continues, and I acknowledge it is an \u2018if,\u2019 that creates a much better context for dealing with the very significant and serious problems that remain in Iraq.\u201d \n \n But the tiny military presence under the Obama administration\u2019s plan \u2014 limited to several dozen to several hundred officers in an embassy office who would help the Iraqis purchase and field new American military equipment \u2014 and the civilians\u2019 growing portfolio have led some veteran Iraq hands to suggest that thousands of additional troops will be needed after 2011. \n \n \u201cWe need strategic patience here,\u201d Ryan C. Crocker, who served as ambassador in Iraq from 2007 until early 2009, said in an interview. \u201cOur timetables are getting out ahead of Iraqi reality. We do have an Iraqi partner in this. We certainly are not the ones making unilateral decisions anymore. But if they come to us later on this year requesting that we jointly relook at the post-2011 period, it is going to be in our strategic interest to be responsive.\u201d \n \n The array of tasks for which American troops are likely to be needed, military experts and some Iraqi officials say, include training Iraqi forces to operate and logistically support new M-1 tanks, artillery and F-16s they intend to acquire from the Americans; protecting Iraq\u2019s airspace until the country can rebuild its air force; and perhaps assisting Iraq\u2019s special operations units in carrying out counterterrorism operations. \n \n Such an arrangement would need to be negotiated with Iraqi officials, who insisted on the 2011 deadline in the agreement with the Bush administration for removing American forces. With the Obama administration in campaign mode for the coming midterm elections and Iraqi politicians yet to form a government, the question of what future military presence might be needed has been all but banished from public discussion. \n \n \u201cThe administration does not want to touch this question right now,\u201d said one administration official involved in Iraq issues, adding that military officers had suggested that 5,000 to 10,000 troops might be needed. \u201cIt runs counter to their political argument that we are getting out of these messy places,\u201d the official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, added. \u201cAnd it would be quite counterproductive to talk this way in front of the Iraqis. If the Iraqis want us, they should be the demandeur.\u201d ||||| U.S. military officials are hustling to reduce the number of troops in Iraq to 50,000 to meet President Obama's Aug. 31 deadline for an end to U.S. combat operations, but as troops leave, the administration reportedly is planning to double the number of private security guards in the country. \n \n A senior military official in Iraq said the Defense Department will meet the deadline for exiting combat troops. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT ADVERTISEMENT \n \n \"We are sitting around 55k and will be down to 50k by 1 September,\" the official wrote in an e-mail to Fox News. \n \n The bulk of the 4th Stryker Brigade from the 2nd Infantry Division left the country on Thursday.

At the same time, Afghanistan is asking the United States to remove a bulk of its 45,000 private contractors from the country. \n \n Contractors employed by the State Department will train the Iraqi police and U.S. diplomats in two new $100 million outposts will be left to defuse sectarian tensions in northern Iraq. \n \n The security contractors, defending five fortified compounds around the country, will operate radars to warn of enemy rocket attacks, search for roadside bombs, fly reconnaissance drones and staff quick reaction forces to help civilians in distress, the officials told the Times. \n \n As the exit of the troops was shown live on TV in the U.S. Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley described the end of combat operations as a \"historic moment,\" but vowed that America's long-term commitment was unwavering. \n \n \"The last thing that we want to see is an occasion where we have to send troops back into Iraq yet again so we are ending the combat phase of our involvement in Iraq for a second time,\" he said. \n \n \"We're not ending our involvement in Iraq. We will have important work to do. This is a transition. This is not the end of something. It's a transition to something different. We have a long-term commitment to Iraq.\" \n \n Crowley said that after spending $1 trillion in Iraq and with 4,400 lives lost, the conflict had come \"at high expense.\" \n \n \"We've invested heavily in Iraq and have to do everything we can to preserve that investment to integrate Iraq, along with the neighborhood, into a much more peaceful situation that serves their interests as well as ours. But this is a historic moment.\" \n \n Obama said the events were the beginning of the pullout he promised when he became president. \n \n \"As we mark this milestone in the Iraq war and our troops continue to move out of Iraq, I hope you'll join me in thanking them, and all of our troops and military families, for their service,\" Obama said. \n \n \"My administration will continue to do our part to support the brave men and women in uniform that have sacrificed so much. But supporting our troops and their families is not just the job of the federal government; it's the responsibility of all Americans. \n \n \"Shortly after taking office, I put forward a plan to end the war in Iraq responsibly. Today, I'm pleased to report that -- thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians in Iraq -- our combat mission will end this month, and we will complete a substantial drawdown of our troops. \n \n \"Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all of our troops will be out of Iraq by the end of next year. Meanwhile, we will continue to build a strong partnership with the Iraqi people with an increased civilian commitment and diplomatic effort.\" \n \n NewsCore contributed to this report.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 The US military may be rolling out of Iraq, but American civilians are not. To protect its outposts, the State Department plans to double the number of private security guards on the ground, finds the New York Times. As many as 7,000 guards will search for roadside bombs, fly reconnaissance drones, and continue training Iraqi police. \u201cWe need strategic patience here,\u201d says a former US ambassador to Iraq. \u201cOur timetables are getting out ahead of Iraqi reality.\" \"I don\u2019t think State has ever operated on its own, independent of the US military, in an environment that is quite as threatening on such a large scale,\u201d said another former ambassador. But, notes Fox News, the contractors won't be entirely on their own\u2014some 50,000 US troops are staying behind through the end of 2011 to train Iraqi forces.

        "Document": "Alan Miller McCarty watched most of his trial Thursday morning from behind one-way glass in a small room after yelling at, interrupting and crudely insulting the presiding judge. \n \n DAYTONA BEACH \u2014 Alan Miller McCarty watched most of his trial Thursday morning from behind one-way glass in a small room after yelling at, interrupting and crudely insulting the presiding judge. \n \n By mid afternoon McCarty was found guilty on all charges related to his threats to kill another judge who ruled in an earlier custody case involving McCarty. \n \n The jury of three women and three men took about 30 minutes to find McCarty guilty of two counts of threats or extortion and two counts of corruption by threat against a public official. Besides threatening the judge, McCarty also threatened a pair of dispatchers in the phone calls. \n \n When the guilty verdicts were read, McCarty was unusually quiet as he sat flanked by deputies. McCarty faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced by Circuit Judge Matt Foxman. Foxman\u2019s next sentencing date is set for Oct. 12. \n \n McCarty, 36, also faces more charges since he is also accused of calling Stewart-Marchman-Act Behavioral Healthcare and threatening staffers there. \n \n The move earlier in the day to the adjacent room didn\u2019t help much as McCarty continued to shout expletives, curse the presiding judge, the witnesses and the entire judicial system. \n \n Everyone in the courtroom \u2014 Judge Foxman, attorneys and the jurors \u2014 could hear McCarty\u2019s screams, which included offensive expletives. He railed that he was not allowed to present evidence. He screamed that his \u201cpapers\u201d had been taken away. He yelled that his attorney was not asking enough questions. And he hollered that his children had been unfairly taken away from him. \n \n McCarty, who was on suicide watch at the Volusia County Branch Jail, refused to dress as defendants typically do for their trials, in shirt, tie and dress pants. Instead, McCarty remained in his jail-issued orange jumpsuit. Also unlike a typical trial, McCarty wore a pair of handcuffs in view of the jury. \n \n McCarty\u2019s morning outbursts included his derisive invitation to the judge to perform oral sex on him. Foxman politely declined by saying, \u201cI prefer not to.\u201d \n \n After McCarty kept screaming, Foxman ordered him into the small room with the one-way glass. McCarty remained there through most of the trial in handcuffs and accompanied by a pair of deputies. \n \n The judge told the jurors that McCarty had chosen to be in the room to which McCarty could be heard screaming that he did not and that his rights had been taken away. \n \n \u201cNo I have not!\u201d McCarty screamed from behind the mirrored glass. \n \n The jurors did not appear to be fazed by McCarty\u2019s screaming. They didn\u2019t even appear to look back to the mirror-like glass where the shouting was coming from. \n \n McCarty, of Milton in Santa Rosa County, was arrested on Sept. 30. He made phone threats toward Circuit Judge Stasia Warren, who ruled in his earlier custody case. \n \n McCarty was flanked by several deputies when the judge permitted him to return to his seat in the courtroom near Assistant Public Defender Ryan Belanger. He told jurors that he was upset that Warren was allowing that his ex-wife get his kids. \n \n That\u2019s why he said he had made the calls in which he threatened to kill Warren. \n \n One juror seemed to have a pained expression on her face during McCarty\u2019s testimony. \n \n Throughout the trial the judge, the jurors, attorneys and deputies were patient and professional in the face of McCarty\u2019s insults or outbursts. \n \n In a press release after the verdict, State Attorney R.J. Larizza said that McCarty\u2019s \u201cvulgar and threatening racist rants were as chilling and offensive as any I have ever heard. Threatening Judges is an attack on the very heart of our Criminal Justice System.\u201d \n \n Belanger said during his closing argument that the squeaky wheel gets the grease and McCarty was a very squeaky wheel. He said McCarty felt he had no other choice since he was losing his children when he made the threats in the calls. \n \n Assistant State Attorney Ashley Terwilleger, who prosecuted the case along with MaryCatherine Crock, said that McCarty\u2019s words mattered and that Warren was fearful that McCarty would make good on his threats. She also said McCarty\u2019s children had been in Texas since about 2007 and he had not seen them for two years before his arrest last year. \n \n As he was questioned by Belanger, McCarty said his statements on the phone calls were just words. McCarty said he didn\u2019t mean it, just like Foxman didn\u2019t mean it, McCarty said, when the judge on Monday threatened to have the defendant\u2019s mouth taped shut if he didn\u2019t behave during the trial. \n \n Foxman did not follow through on the duct tape but the courtroom was staffed with extra deputies. And while McCarty did not have any adhesive tape around his mouth he did wear an electric belt under his jumpsuit that would allow a deputy to deliver a stunning zap if needed. \n \n McCarty called dispatchers on Sept. 29 and threatened Warren, who hears juvenile delinquency and dependency cases. \n \n \u201cWhere\u2019s your Judge Warren at?\u201d McCarty is recorded telling dispatchers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to bring that (expletive deleted) out in handcuffs and I\u2019m going to (expletive deleted) execute that (expletive deleted) right in the (expletive deleted) street.\u201d \n \n Judge Warren took the stand in the morning and testified that she had been frightened when she was told of the threats McCarty had made against her life. \n \n McCarty was in the small room while Warren testified and would occasionally shout out something. He called Warren \u201can (expletive) liar\u201d at one point during the morning. \n \n Warren started to say something directed at McCarty, but Belanger objected and Foxman sustained it. \n \n As McCarty was about to be escorted out of the courtroom, he said he wanted to press charges against Foxman. McCarty said Foxman had threatened him with taping his mouth shut. \n \n The judge told him one of the bailiffs would take the report from him as McCarty was led out of the courtroom and back to jail. ||||| DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for threatening to kill a judge he believed ruled against him in his custody case. \n \n The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports 36-year-old Alan McCarty Jr. spent much of the hearing in an adjacent room with a speaker and one-way glass, just like he did during his trial, after unleashing a fresh stream of obscenities Wednesday at the judge, the prosecutor and even his own public defender. \n \n McCarty was convicted last month of threatening to kill Circuit Judge Stasia Warren last year when he mistakenly blamed her for taking his kids away in a custody case. \n \n A prosecutor's statement says the 20-year sentence will give McCarty ample time to reflect on the seriousness of his threats against the judicial system.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Florida's Alan McCarty has made clear he does not like judges, and he will spend the next 20 years in prison as a result. The 36-year-old received the 20-year sentence this week\u2014along with an extra 10 days for contempt of court, a penalty more serious than it sounds\u2014for calling 911 last year and promising to kill a judge he mistakenly believed had ruled against him in a custody case, reports the Daytona Beach News Journal. During Wednesday's sentencing in front of a different judge, Matt Foxman, McCarty had to be removed from the courtroom as Foxman listed his offenses. \u201cWhat a bunch of (expletive) lies you stupid piece of (expletive),\u201d McCarty yelled. \u201cYou threatened my life, (expletive, expletive). (Expletive) you, you (expletive, expletive).\u201d Foxman explained that he was tacking on the 10-day contempt of court sentence for a variety of reasons, including one particular McCarty outburst during the trial. \u201cYou also offered me to perform a sex act upon you, which I politely declined and still do to this day for whatever that\u2019s worth,\u201d Foxman said. The extra 10 days will be served when the 20-year sentence is done, and it's no small thing, explains the News Journal. It means that McCarty won't be able to participate in a work-release program while in prison. McCarty also was convicted of threatening 911 dispatchers, reports GateHouse Media Florida, which notes that because of his courtroom behavior, McCarty had to observe most of his trial from behind one-way glass."

Officers surrounded a silver Hyundai Elantra in the parking lot of an Aspen Hill Kohl's store, and the suspect, 62-year-old Eulalio Tordil was inside. \n \n FOX 5's Alexandra Limon was live on the air when police began rushing across the street from the parking lot of a Giant food store, where one of two shootings took place on Friday morning. Limon's crew was quickly moved away, but moments later, things settled-- and Tordil was in custody. (WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE) \n \n Shortly thereafter, Montgomery County Police confirmed that a suspect was indeed in custody, and it was Tordil. He was arrested in the parking lot of the same shopping center where the D.C. Beltway sniper attacks began. The first shot was fired to the Michaels craft store, which is still there, on October 2, 2002. Investigators said Tordil ate at the same restaurant, a Boston Market, where John Allen Mohammed and Lee Boyd Malvo ate. \n \n Earlier Friday, two people were killed in two separate shootings in Montgomery County. The first happened outside Montgomery Mall, and the second outside the Aspen Hill Giant grocery store. \n \n MONTGOMERY MALL SHOOTING \n \n On Friday morning at around 11:13 am, an off-duty officer called dispatch and other officers that shots were fired during a confrontation outside of Westfield Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, and two men and a woman were wounded. One of the men died, and the second man is in critical condition at Suburban Hospital. The female victim is also at the hospital in stable condition with non-life threatening injuries. \n \n Police said they believed two of the people who were shot at that scene were hit when they came to the aid of the first victim. \n \n Westfield Montgomery released the following statement regarding the shootings after Tordil was arrested: \n \n \"There was a shooting this morning in the parking lot of Westfield Montgomery and the suspect immediately fled the scene. We worked closely with Montgomery County PD on site and the center remained open serving as shelter for those who wished to remain inside. We are grateful to local law enforcement for their efforts to secure the site and insure the safety of the community. \n \n All of us in this community are shocked and saddened by these events. We send our heartfelt condolences to the victims of this tragedy and their families. \n \n We encourage you to follow official updates on Montgomery County Police Department.\" \n \n ASPEN HILL SHOOTING \n \n At around 11:50 p.m., a second shooting was reported outside a Giant grocery store in Aspen Hill located on Connecticut Avenue. Montgomery County police confirmed that one woman was shot in her car, and she was pronounced dead at the scene. \n \n SUSPECT ARRESTED \n \n Before Tordil's arrest, Montgomery County police confirmed they were looking into the possibility that Friday's shootings were connected to another deadly shooting that took place on Thursday afternoon outside a High Point High School in Beltsville, Md. Detectives say Tordil shot and killed his estranged wife outside the school in what investigators called a domestic-related shooting. Another man was also shot as he tried to intervene and help the victim. \n \n On Thursday night, police issued an alert for Tordil, who was said to be driving a silver 2015 Hyundai Elantra with Pennsylvania license plate JZA0123. Tordil is an employee of the Federal Protection Service, and police warned that he may have been wearing body armor and may be heavily armed. \n \n Also before the arrest, sources told FOX 5's Marina Marraco that Friday's shootings were connected to Thursday night's shooting, but Montgomery County Police Captain Paul Starks said he could not confirm a connection, and they were continuing to look into the possibility of a connection. \n \n In a press conference late Friday afternoon with officials from both counties, authorities said Tordil was the alleged gunman in all three shootings. Police said officers responding to the Giant parking lot shooting located the vehicle that matched the description parked in the Northgate Shopping Center. \n \n Montgomery County Police Chief Tom Manger said plainclothes officers had Tordil under surveillance in the area and they were extremely careful to make sure they kept the public safe. Authorities said he had earlier threatened to \"commit suicide by cop.\" \n \n \"We had him under surveillance and he was walking from store to store and at no point was it safe to take him into custody until we did,\" said Manger. \n \n After he came out of the Dunkin' Donuts, police cornered Tordil at his car. \n \n \"They came in from all directions,\" said one witness. \"They boxed him in, they rammed the car from the front and the back, pulled guns on him and told him to get out of the vehicle.\" \n \n Without a single gunshot from both police and the suspect, Tordil exited his car and surrendered peacefully. \n \n CHARGES \n \n On Friday night, Prince George's County police officially charged Tordil with first-degree murder and related charges for the fatal shooting of his wife. He was also charged with assault for shooting a bystander who attempted to intervene in the confrontation between the couple. \n \n Charges are pending against Tordil in connection to the shootings in Montgomery County. He was in custody Friday night at Montgomery County police headquarters being interviewed. He will be arraigned in District Court Monday afternoon. \n \n SCHOOLS ON ALERT \n \n A shelter-in-place order was issued for all Montgomery County schools out of what Starks called an abundance of caution, but just before 2:30 pm, that order was lifted at all but five schools. Following Tordil's arrest, all shelter-in-place orders were lifted. \n \n Stay with FOX 5 and fox5dc.com for updates. ||||| A suspected gunman is in custody after two people were killed in separate shootings at a mall and grocery store in Montgomery County, Maryland, today, and police say the shootings may be linked to a deadly domestic shooting in the area yesterday. \n \n The suspect, Eulalio Tordil, 62, was taken into custody today in the Aspen Hill, Maryland, area, police said.

Other than his wife, none of the victims has yet been publicly identified. In a statement late Friday, Montgomery police said Tordil was \u201ccurrently being interviewed by detectives,\u201d and they indicated that he had not been charged in that jurisdiction. \u00ad \n \n The killing began Thursday afternoon, investigators say, when Tordil approached his estranged wife, Gladys Tordil, as she waited in a parking lot at High Point High School in Beltsville to pick up her two daughters. \n \n When a man tried to intervene, authorities said, Tordil shot him in the shoulder. They say Tordil then pointed his weapon at his wife\u2019s SUV, firing repeatedly until she died. \n \n At that moment, her 16-year-old daughter was walking out of a nearby band room. Hearing the shots, another student pulled her back inside and ran to alert others. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s when the whole school panicked,\u201d said 17-year-old Chris Mejia, High Point\u2019s senior class president. \n \n \n \n \n \n In March, at the behest of his wife, a civil court issued a protective order against Tordil for alleged abuse, according to court documents. In the filing, she claimed that her husband, a black belt in the martial-art form of aikido, subjected her children to \u201cintense-military-like discipline\u201d and that he struck her in 2010. \n \n \u201cHe threatened to harm me,\u201d she said, \u201cif I leave him.\u201d \n \n As a result of the order, his employer, the Federal Protective Service, put him on administrative duties and stripped him of his gun and badge. Authorities say they also confiscated a stockpile of his personal weapons. His wife indicated in the protective order that he owned .40-caliber and .45-caliber handguns, an M4 military carbine, a revolver and a \u201chunting gun.\u201d \n \n Under \u201cfavorite quotes\u201d on Tordil\u2019s Facebook page, it lists a single misspelled line: \u201cYou can ran, but you can\u2019t hide.\u201d \n \n Authorities tried to begin tracking Tordil immediately after the shooting at High Point. \n \n They had little to work with and were contending with a suspect whose career in law enforcement made him even harder to pursue, said Prince George\u2019s County Police Chief Henry P. Stawinski III. \n \n Tordil had turned off his phone 20 minutes before the first shooting and never turned it back on. Video of the shooting was grainy and showed only a silver sedan, but police quickly learned that he had leased the Elantra and knew the Pennsylvania license plate number. \n \n That provided them the only firm nugget of information to track their suspect. \n \n Police didn\u2019t release details about the car to the public Thursday night, fearing Tordil might catch on and abandon it, Stawin\u00adski said. But they did inform other law enforcement officers. \n \n \u201cHe is a police officer, and he would be doing countersurveillance on us and watching the media,\u201d the chief said. \u201cIf he knew we knew that was his car, he would get rid of the car.\u201d \n \n More than 100 undercover officers, homicide detectives and special patrol teams from Prince George\u2019s alone fanned throughout the region. The car\u2019s license tag was spotted around midnight, but Tordil eluded authorities throughout the night. \n \n The violence on Friday began about 11:15 a.m., police said, when Tordil fatally shot one man and wounded another man and a woman in the parking lot of Westfield Montgomery Mall. Police said they think that Tordil shot two of the three as they rushed to help the first victim. As of late Friday night, they said the wounded man was in critical condition and the woman in stable condition with non-life-threatining injuries. \n \n Jose Mauricio Gomez, 54, was eating lunch in his pickup when he heard six to eight shots. When a police officer pulled up next to him, Gomez realized that the crime scene was nearby. \n \n Neither man spotted the shooter, but they did see one victim, a woman with a shoulder wound. \n \n The officer asked the woman, who appeared to be in her 30s, whether she could stand. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s when blood shot out of the hole in her shoulder and he sat her back down,\u201d Gomez said. \n \n The only thing she talked about, he recalled, was how upset her husband was going to be. \n \n While at that scene, officers received a 911 call from the Giant grocery store in Aspen Hill, nine miles away, where a woman had been shot to death in her car. \n \n Soon after, a plainclothes officer spotted Tordil\u2019s car parked across the street from the grocery store, according to McCarthy. Investigators soon realized Tordil was still nearby after showing wanted fliers at area businesses. \n \n Tordil, McCarthy said, first got a cup of coffee at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, then went to Michaels craft store to \u201cbrowse around\u201d before heading to Boston Market, where he quietly ate lunch near a window. \n \n As many as 100 officers kept up surveillance but resisted closing in to avoid a bloody firefight in a bustling shopping area. \n \n \u201cWe needed to make sure the public was safe when we took him into custody,\u201d said Montgomery County Police Chief J. Thomas Manger. \u201cOur fear was he was armed, since he already shot four people today.\u201d \n \n When Tordil returned to his car, officers swarmed. \n \n He was soon led away in handcuffs, with either rain or sweat soaked through his jeans and light-brown polo. \n \n \u201cThe judgments made today by police saved a lot of lives,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThis went down exactly as planned.\u201d \n \n Authorities have no evidence that Tordil knew the people he has been accused of attacking on Friday, leaving investigators to sort through his motivation. \n \n It also remains unclear what led him to allegedly kill his wife, a mother of two teen girls who supported her children and family members in the Philippines. \n \n Gladys Tordil, who taught chemistry at Parkdale High, should have been honored this week \u2014 both for National Teacher Appreciation Week and Mother\u2019s Day \u2014 and not killed in front of her daughter, said Mejia, the student body president. \n \n \u201cMy niece had her as a teacher last year. She said she was a great person,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was always happy, always singing, always dancing.\u201d \n \n On the door of her classroom, more than 100 hand-scrawled sticky notes captured what she had meant to those left behind, a mosaic of memories on squares of pink, blue, green and yellow. \n \n Read one: \u201cTo the reason I\u2019m pursuing Chemistry.\u201d Another: \u201cThank you Mrs. Tordil!

Thomas Manger said. \n \n Police waited about an hour to make the arrest, fearing Tordil was armed, and closed in when he got into his vehicle, Manger said. A weapon was found in the vehicle, he said. \n \n Tordil is an employee of the Federal Protective Service , which protects federal facilities and is part of Homeland Security. \n \n He was placed on administrative duties in March after a protective order was issued against him, the FPS said. \n \n Estranged wife obtained protective order \n \n In March 2016, a Prince George's County district judge ordered that Tordil have no contact with his estranged wife, Gladys Tordil, and two minors thought to be their children. \n \n According to the court documents, Tordil had access to at least three revolvers, which the court ordered him to carry only during work. He had to leave them at his workplace. The FPS said it went one step further after the protective order, removing Tordil's duty weapon, badge and credentials. \n \n Gladys Tordil alleged that Eulalio \"has been subjecting them to intense military-like discipline -- push ups, detention in dark closet,\" according to the order. She said, \"He threatened to harm me if I leave him,\" the documents say. \n \n Prince George's County police charged Eulalio Tordil on Friday with first-degree murder in the shooting of his wife, the department said in a news release posted on its website. He was charged with assault for allegedly shooting a man who tried to intervene. \n \n Montgomery County police have not announced any charges. \n \n Shootings UPDATE: Suspect IN CUSTODY in Aspen Hill area: Eulalio Tordil, 62. Press Conference to be held. Time: TBD pic.twitter.com/cHQJRPa9uP \u2014 Montgomery Co Police (@mcpnews) May 6, 2016 \n \n First shooting at high school \n \n All the shootings happened in parking lots. Besides those killed, three people were wounded. Police said they don't know whether Tordil had a relationship with any of the other people who were shot other than Gladys Tordil. \n \n Law enforcement authorities had been looking for Tordil since Thursday, when Gladys Tordil, 44, was killed outside High Point High School in Beltsville in adjacent Prince George's County, police said. The school was one of the places Tordil was ordered to stay away from in the court order. \n \n It appeared Tordil followed her to the school property as she came to pick up her children and confronted her as she sat in her car, police said. \n \n A passerby was shot as he tried to intervene and suffered non-life-threatening injuries, according to a police report. After the wife was shot multiple times, the gunman left the scene, police said. \n \n CNN Map \n \n Around 11 a.m. Friday morning, one man was fatally shot outside Westfield Montgomery mall in Bethesda, according to police. A man and woman were wounded, police said. The man is in critical condition and the woman in stable condition with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. \n \n While officers were investigating that shooting, they received a call at 11:50 a.m. about a shooting in the Giant supermarket parking lot in Aspen Hill, Manger said. Officers found a woman fatally shot inside her vehicle. \n \n Officers searching for the suspect found his vehicle in a nearby shopping center parking lot, then spotted him inside businesses, he said. \n \n Manger said police decided not to confront Tordil right away because they thought he was armed. The suspect spent about an hour in various businesses and ate lunch at a Boston Market, the chief said. \n \n \"He was walking from store to store and at no point was it safe for us to take him into custody until we did,\" Manger said. \"We needed to make sure the public was safe when we took him into custody.\" \n \n When the suspect got in his car, police blocked the vehicle and made the arrest, the official said. \n \n Tordil is expected in court at 1 p.m. Monday in Rockville District Court, police said. \n \n Remembering the D.C. snipers \n \n The area where Tordil was arrested had significance for residents of the District of Columbia. \n \n The D.C.-area snipers , who killed 10 people in 2002, passed through the area, Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy said. \n \n \"They ate in the same restaurant where we were having the surveillance today, which was an irony that was not lost on me,\" he said. \n \n During three weeks in October 2002 , John Allen Muhammad and accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo, then 17, killed 10 people and wounded three, while taunting police with written messages and phoned-in threats and demands. \n \n Muhammed was executed in 2009. Malvo is serving a life sentence. \n \n \"Today's incident was very reminiscent of fear that permeated throughout our communities during the 2002 sniper shootings,\" Prince George's County Executive Rushern L. Baker III said in a statement on the county government website. \"It was also another harsh reality of the terror that gun violence can create.\"",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Two people are dead following shootings at a shopping mall and grocery store Friday in Maryland, and police have a possible suspect in custody. The first shooting took place around 11am outside the Westfield Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, with two men and one woman hit, Fox 5 DC reports. Two of the victims were reportedly shot when attempting to help the first victim, and all three were hospitalized. According to ABC News, one of the men has died and another victim is in critical condition. Police say there is no indication the shooter knew the victims, the AP reports. The second shooting took place at a grocery store about eight miles from the mall and left a woman dead, the Washington Post reports. It's unclear if the two shootings are related. Police say Eulalio Tordil, wanted on suspicion of shooting and killing his estranged wife outside a Maryland high school on Thursday, may be responsible for one or both of Friday's shootings. He was arrested Friday afternoon, according to NBC News. Tordil allegedly followed his wife to the school, where she was picking up her children, and shot her. Police say he also shot and injured a person attempting to help his wife. CNN reports the 62-year-old Tordil is a law enforcement officer with the Federal Protective Service who was put on administrative leave in March after a protective order was issued against him."

It could also lead to other changes on the borders Britain and France imposed on the Middle East a century ago, starting with break-up of Iraq on sectarian lines. \n \n The success of ISIS can only make the turmoil in the Middle East worse. ISIS is an ultra extremist Sunni Muslim group. Its success will deepen the sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shias that is already the most dangerous fault line in the Middle East. \n \n Iran, which is a majority Shia Muslim country, shares a border with Iraq. It has a direct line to Iraq's Shia Muslim Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki, and close links with some Iraqi Shia militias. The Iranians could direct their proxies, and even their own special forces units, at ISIS. \n \n That might end up further inflaming the anger of Iraqi Sunnis, who have already helped the advance of ISIS through Iraq. \n \n US air strikes, if they happen, might do the same thing.

        "Document": "By Phil Williams \n \n Chief Investigative Reporter \n \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. -- Are leaders of a for-profit public school trying to hide the fact their students are failing? \n \n That's the question that some are asking tonight as a result of an email uncovered by NewsChannel 5 Investigates. \n \n At the center of the controversy is the Tennessee Virtual Academy -- a for-profit, online public school that Republican lawmakers touted as a way to improve education in Tennessee. Two years ago, state lawmakers voted to let K12 Inc. open the school, using millions of taxpayer dollars. \n \n But, now, those lawmakers are concerned about standardized test results that put it among the worst schools in the state. \n \n In fact, the email suggests that even school leaders are becoming increasingly concerned by how their students' grades may look to parents and the public. \n \n \"That is not something I would ever be told in my school -- I mean, it's just not acceptable,\" said state Rep. Gloria Johnson, a Knoxville Democrat who is also a career teacher. \"Quite honestly, I was horrified.\" \n \n The email -- labeled \"important -- was written in December by the Tennessee Virtual Academy's vice principal to middle school teachers. \n \n \"After ... looking at so many failing grades, we need to make some changes before the holidays,\" the email begins. \n \n Among the changes: Each teacher \"needs to take out the October and September progress [reports]; delete it so that all that is showing is November progress.\" \n \n \"Does it talk about we need to make changes in curriculum? Does it talk about we need to make changes in our teaching strategy? No,\" Rep. Johnson observed. \"Those changes we need to make are deleting grades from the computer system.\" \n \n \"And that's cheating in your mind?\" NewsChannel 5 Investigates asked. \n \n \"In my mind, sure. I mean, yes.\" \n \n The email adds, \"This cannot be late!\" \n \n \"To come in and say 'everybody who made failing grades the first two months, we need to delete those grades,' to me that's a huge issue,\" Johnson added. \n \n And the suggestions from K12 leaders don't end there. \n \n In traditional classrooms, if students score a 60 on one test and a 90 on a second test, they're stuck with a 75 average. But the email suggests that teachers erase the bad grades, leaving students with just the good grades. \n \n The email continues, \"If you have given an assignment and most of your students failed that assignment, then you need to take that grade out.\" \n \n Read the TNVA email, response \n \n \"This doesn't say give them a second chance,\" we noted. \n \n \"No, it does not,\" the lawmaker agreed. \"It just says take that out. To me, this appears like it's grade fixing.\" \n \n K12 officials refused to sit down to answer our questions, but the Tennessee Virtual Academy's principal said in an email that the goal was to \"more accurately recognize students' current progress.\" \n \n \"By going back into our school's electronic grading system and recording students' most recent progress score (instead of taking the average throughout the semester) we could more accurately recognize students' current progress in their individualized learning program,\" principal Josh Williams said in the statement. \n \n \"This also helped differentiate those and identify those who needed instructional intervention and remediation.\" \n \n Williams compared K12's grade deletions to the \"common practice in traditional schools\" of allowing \"make-up tests, alternative assessments and extra credit opportunities.\" \n \n Yet, the internal email also suggests that Virtual Academy teachers had already attempted those sorts of efforts to boost student grades. \n \n \"In early December, all teachers gave their students an opportunity to improve their grades by giving additional assignments,\" it says. \n \n \"Yet, we are still seeing failing grades.\" \n \n As to K12's explanation, Mitchell Johnson, interim director of the Tennessee Education Association, questioned how deleting data helps K12 to better understand students' needs. \n \n \"They're probably changing the grades to make themselves look better,\" he speculated. \n \n It's a practice that the TEA official suggested would not sit well with privatization advocates if they saw a \"delete it\" email from a traditional public school. \n \n \"I think that they would be incensed, and I'm hoping that the reformers will be as incensed about what has happened here -- as they would be if it had happened within a public school setting,\" he added. \n \n In the email, teachers were also told that their main focus is on reading and math -- and that they are not as concerned about students making F's in history and science. \n \n But the principal of the Tennessee Virtual Academy noted that, ultimately, the school's success or failure will be judged based on the standardized tests that students take at the end of the year -- not on individual grades. \n \n Because of concerns about the Tennessee Virtual Academy's performance, Gov. Bill Haslam has proposed legislation that would cap the number of students who could enroll at 5,000. It's at about 3,200 right now. \n \n There is also a bill up in a House subcommittee Tuesday that would essentially shut it down. \n \n E-mail: pwilliams@newschannel5.com ||||| Humphrey on the Hill Tom Humphrey's blog on politics and legislative news in Tennessee \n \n NASHVILLE \u2014 A House committee killed legislation that would have closed Union County-based Tennessee Virtual Academy on Tuesday after one Knoxville legislator effectively blocked another from talking to the committee about allegations that the for-profit school altered the bad grades of some students. \n \n Instead, the House Education Subcommittee approved a bill pushed by Gov. Bill Haslam's administration that puts some new restrictions on virtual schools, but only after eliminating \u2014 with the governor's approval \u2014 a proposed 5,000-student enrollment cap that was originally part of House Bill 151. \n \n Democratic Rep. Mike Stewart of Nashville sponsored the bill (HB728) that would have effectively repealed the law passed in 2011 that allowed for-profit virtual schools to operate in Tennessee. \n \n The 2011 bill was sponsored by Rep. Harry Brooks, R-Knoxville, who is now chairman of the House Education Committee and sponsor of the Haslam administration bill changing some rules for running virtual schools. \n \n Stewart told the committee that Tennessee Virtual Academy, part of a system of virtual schools operated around the nation by K12 Inc., has proved itself in a year of operation a \"bad idea\" for both its students, who have had low scores in testing, and for taxpayers. \n \n \"The only people that are benefiting are in K12, a Virginia corporation that is rising statewide to siphon off millions of dollars every year ... for enormous profits,\" said Stewart, adding that K12 CEO Ronald Packard was paid $3.9 million last year and $5 million the year before. \n \n Rep. Roger Kane, R-Knoxville, told Stewart his talk of Packard's salary was a \"red herring\" and otherwise criticized the Nashville lawmaker's statements \u2014 drawing applause from perhaps 25 Virtual Academy teachers, students and parents of students in the audience. \n \n One Virtual Academy teacher, Summer Shelton of Knoxville, told the panel she had taught in Knox County and elsewhere \u2014 including Europe \u2014 and considered the academy as having \"the most dynamic curriculum\" and the best overall, especially beneficial to children with special problems, such as feeling stressed in regular schools. \n \n Legislative staff found that Tennessee Virtual Academy is receiving $7.5 million in state funding this year. \n \n Stewart told the committee that the company receives $5,300 per student \"essential to turn on a website\" and has refused to give any information on how much it spends \u2014 which he estimated at $1,000 to $2,000 per student. He challenged K12 to provide the information, though there was no response during the session. \n \n After the meeting, Ken Meyer, director of government relations for K12, told reporters that Stewart's figures are wrong and K12 has lost money in its first year of operation. \n \n Actually, he said the Tennessee operation gets $4,700 per student, gives Union County about $300 in accordance with its contract, and thus receives only about $4,400 per student. Meyer said the company's costs are about $6,600 per student, adding he was going by memory and would give more precise figures later. \n \n Stewart also cited an email sent to Virtual Academy teachers in December that says they should \"take out the October and September progress (reports); delete it so that all that is showing is November progress reports.\" \n \n He distributed the email, which was provided by Rep. Gloria Johnson, D-Knoxville, to him and to WTVF-TV in Nashville, which aired a report on the matter Monday evening. Johnson, a Knox County schoolteacher, said she had been given the email by a Virtual Academy teacher. \n \n Stewart asked that Johnson be allowed to speak to the committee. Brooks objected, saying the email had nothing to do with the Stewart bill under discussion. The committee chairman made a motion to end all discussion and proceed immediately to a vote on the bill. \n \n Rep. Mark White, R-Memphis, presiding at the subcommittee meeting, promptly declared Brooks' motion approved by voice vote, then immediately called for a vote on the bill. It was declared defeated on voice vote. \n \n Afterward, Johnson and Shelton spent several minutes discussing the email, which Shelton said had been misunderstood. She said the school had a new \"grade book\" for teachers to report student progress. Some teachers were averaging grades while others were using the most recent grade, Shelton said. The email was to clarify that the most recent grade \u2014 as a measure of progress \u2014 should be used, she said. In many situations, she said the student had taken a test twice, in which case the second grade is used. \n \n After hearing out Shelton, Johnson said she understood much of the lengthy explanation, but overall \"it's not quite jiving 100 percent.\" She also questioned why K12 or Virtual Academy executives had not testified or answered questions. \n \n The Haslam administration bill, sponsored by Brooks, was approved on a 6-3 vote. \n \n As amended, it imposes a 1,500-student cap on new virtual schools launched in the state, but not on those already operating. The original bill would have covered Tennessee Virtual Academy \u2014 which now has about 3,200 students \u2014 with a 5,000 cap. That was dropped by an amendment. \n \n The bill has other provisions that declare a virtual school that has below-standard student performance for two consecutive years can be closed by the state's education commission. \n \n The commissioner would also have the option to instead impose an enrollment cap.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Tennessee Virtual Academy, a for-profit, online public school heavily supported by state Republicans, has found a novel way of boosting student performance\u2014just delete bad grades, reports News Channel 5 in Nashville. A leaked December email from the school's VP appears to tell its middle-school teachers to erase some scores that don't measure up. \"If you have given an assignment and most of your students failed that assignment, then you need to take that grade out,\" it reads. \"To me, this appears like it's grade fixing,\" said one Democratic state representative. Virginia-based parent company K12 is refusing to talk, but the TVA principal said the deletions were intended to \"more accurately recognize students' current progress.\" But as the two-year-old school will receive $7.5 million in funding from the state this year, many Tennessee lawmakers are outraged. The Knoxville News Sentinel reports that a House bill that proposed shutting the school altogether was killed yesterday; a second was passed by the House Education Subcommittee. It would allow the state to shutter a virtual school that records sub-standard student performance two years in a row. (Meanwhile, a Lehigh University student is suing over a bad grade.)"

They said they were looking for a quiet, idyllic place to raise their family. \n \n \u201cWe have three small kids. We came back here because we wanted to get away from the big city and the crime. So this is crazy,\u201d said Erin Johnson. \n \n When they heard the news, he said, \u201cShe started crying, I ran back to the house to get my gun.\u201d \n \n For his part, Ward stopped at the gas station to buy Big Reds and beers, just around the corner from the church. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m still in shock right now. I can\u2019t believe it,\u201d he said. \n \n He ruffled the hair of his 9-year-old daughter, McKinley Ward. Her cousins are in the hospital so she\u2019s \u201csad and worried and scared,\u201d she said. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m scared something else might happen,\u201d she said. \n \n The Ward family is just waiting now to hear if their injured family members will survive. McKinley said she thinks they will. \n \n Just after 6 p.m., after a day of hospital visits and phone calls, trauma and tears, she and her parents retreated to the safe confines of their home. As she opened the fence to her house, the light from their porch illuminated McKinley\u2019s purple shirt, which read \u201cCourage is found in unlikely places.\u201d \n \n A few blocks away, a vigil on a grassy street corner was in full swing. People held candles above their tear-stained faces and prayed. They locked hands, wrapped their arms around each others\u2019 shoulders or raised their hands to the sky. \n \n Sutherland Springs is a small community, but in that moment, the swell of emotion couldn\u2019t have been larger. \n \n sfosterfrau@express-news.net | Twitter: @SilviaElenaFF ||||| A 14-year-old daughter of the pastor of a Baptist church in rural Texas was among those killed in a mass shooting at the church Sunday morning, the father told ABC News. \n \n Interested in Texas Church Shooting?

Texas Department of Public Safety Regional Director Freeman Martin said this afternoon that the victims ranged from 5 years old to 72 years old. \n \n A law enforcement official reports that 26 people are dead and about 20 others were injured. \n \n The fatality count makes it one of the deadliest mass shootings in American history. ||||| (CNN) At least 26 people were killed in Sunday's church shooting in Sutherland Springs, Texas, Gov. Greg Abbott said at a press conference. \n \n About 20 others were wounded, said Freeman Martin, a regional director with the Texas Department of Public Safety, with victims ranging in age from 5 to 72 years old. \n \n Among the dead is the 14-year-old daughter of the First Baptist Church's pastor, Frank Pomeroy, according to his wife, Sherri Pomeroy, the girl's mother. The couple were traveling out of state when the shooting occurred. \n \n Authorities have not said what may have motivated the suspected shooter, who was later found dead in his vehicle. \n \n The shooting has devastated the small Texas town east of San Antonio, described as a place where \"everybody knows everybody.\" \n \n Here are the latest developments: \n \n The suspected shooter has been identified as 26-year-old Devin Patrick Kelley, according to two law enforcement sources who have been briefed on the investigation. \n \n In April 2016, Kelley purchased the Ruger AR-556 rifle he used in the shooting from an Academy Sports & Outdoors store in San Antonio, Texas, a law enforcement official said. He indicated he didn't have a disqualifying criminal history when he filled out the background check paperwork at the store, the official said. Kelley listed a Colorado Springs, Colorado, address when he bought the gun. \n \n Kelley was a member of the US Air Force and served at Holloman Air Force Base in New Mexico from 2010 until his discharge, according to Air Force spokeswoman Ann Stefanek. \n \n Kelley was court-martialed in 2012 for assault on his spouse and assault on their child, according to Stefanek. Kelley served a year in prison and received a bad conduct discharge in 2014, the spokeswoman said. His rank was also reduced, she said. \n \n Speaking from Japan, President Donald Trump condemned the shooting as an \"act of evil\" and called it \"horrific.\" \n \n \"We don't know names of any of the victims at this time,\" said Wilson County Sheriff Joe Tackitt in a press conference Sunday evening. As victims are identified, next of kin will be notified, he said. \n \n The attack \n \n Without naming Kelley, Martin described the shooter in Sunday's press conference as a young white male who was dressed in all-black \"tactical-type gear\" and wearing a ballistic vest. \n \n Martin said the suspect was seen in a Valero gas station across the street from the church in Sutherland Springs at about 11:20 a.m. local time on Sunday morning. \n \n The suspect left the gas station, crossed the street, exited his vehicle and began firing before he entered the church, Martin said. \n \n As the suspected shooter left the church, a local resident used their own rifle to engage him, Martin said. The shooter then fled the church, while the citizen pursued him. \n \n After a brief chase, law enforcement later found the suspect dead of a gunshot wound inside his vehicle. A law enforcement official briefed on the investigation said multiple weapons were found in Kelley's car. Authorities said they don't know if the wound was self-inflicted or the result of the resident who fired on the suspect, Martin said. \n \n The shooter was killed after a brief chase north into neighboring Guadalupe County, Guadalupe County Sheriff's Office spokesman Robert Murphy said earlier on Sunday. \n \n The community \n \n Sutherland Springs is in Wilson County, about 30 miles east of San Antonio. \n \n \"My heart is broken,\" Wilson County Commissioner Albert Gamez Jr. told CNN. \"We never think where it can happen, and it does happen. It doesn't matter where you're at. In a small community, real quiet and everything, and look at this.\" \n \n Dana Fletcher, who owns a business down the road from the church, told CNN's Fredricka Whitfield that Sutherland Springs is a \"very small\" but \"very tight-knit community.\" \n \n \"There's two gas stations, the church, a community center, post office, a Dollar General, a tire shop,\" she said. \"That's about it.\" \n \n The FBI was on the scene of the shooting, according to Michelle Lee, spokeswoman for the FBI's San Antonio field office. Agents from the San Antonio field office of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives also headed to the scene, a law enforcement source said. \n \n After the shooting, about 100 family members of victims gathered in a community center next to the church, waiting for news of their loved ones, 26-year-old David Flores told CNN. Local law enforcement, the FBI and the Red Cross were also at the community center. \n \n \"My dad saw the gunman run into the church building and then he heard shots and saw people running,\" Flores told CNN. \"People covered in blood and screaming. It was pandemonium everywhere.\" \n \n \"Looking around, it's very sorrowful and the pastors from all the local churches right now are just trying to console everybody,\" said Flores when asked to describe the scene inside the community center. \n \n \"There were several children injured,\" he said. \"I know three, personally, who are in critical condition.\" \n \n The victims \n \n The Connally Memorial Medical Center in nearby Floresville, Texas, received 8 patients with gunshot wounds from the Sutherland Springs church shooting, a statement from the hospital said. Four of those patients were transferred to University Hospital in San Antonio to receive a higher level of care. \n \n One of those patients was in critical condition and needed to be air-lifted. \n \n Three patients were treated at Connally Memorial Medical Center and have been released, the statement said. One patient is in stable condition there. \n \n Photos: Sutherland Springs church shooting Investigators work at the scene of a mass shooting at the First Baptist Church in Sutherland Springs, Texas, on Sunday, November 5.

        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 There are 26 people confirmed dead in America's latest horrific mass shooting\u2014including the 14-year-old daughter of Frank Pomeroy, pastor of the First Baptist Church of Sutherland Springs, Texas. Pomeroy tells ABC that Annabelle, his youngest daughter, was a \"very beautiful, special child.\" Pomeroy says he was in Oklahoma Sunday in a rare absence from the church. He says all the people killed were good friends. At least three other children were killed in the attack and others are among the wounded. Sutherland Springs resident Nick Uhlig tells the Houston Chronicle that his cousin, Crystal Holcombe, was eight months pregnant and died along with three of her five children. The two others were badly injured. Uhliq says the church provides community services, including free meals, for the tiny town, where the shooting is believed to have killed or injured close to 10% of the population. \"Everybody can come, it doesn\u2019t matter what religion you are,\" he says. Local business owner Dana Fletcher tells CNN that the community about 30 miles east of San Antonio is very small and very tight-knit. \"There's two gas stations, the church, a community center, post office, a Dollar General, a tire shop,\" she says. Amanda Mosel tells the San Antonio Express-News that the congregation numbers around 50. She says her 13-year-old goddaughter was among those killed. The gunman, identified as Devin Kelley, was found dead in his vehicle after the mass shooting. His motive is still unclear."

The PSA shows viewers missing warning signs of another student planning a shooting, who later appears with an assault rifle. The student is seen being bullied, watching gun videos on YouTube, and sharing gun photos on Instagram. Founded by family members in Newtown, Connecticut, after the December 14, 2012, shooting, the organization aims to prevent gun violence.",

To mark the fourth anniversary of the Sandy Hook school shooting, it is being republished. \n \n Sandy Hook Promise, an organization devoted to protecting children from gun violence that was launched in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School massacre in Newtown, Connecticut, has issued a powerful public service announcement urging people to look for warning signs of potential shooters. \n \n Get push notifications with news, features and more. \n \n In the Dec. 2 PSA, part of the organization\u2019s \u201cKnow the Signs\u201d campaign, viewers are introduced to Evan, a typical teenager, trying to find summer love as the school year winds down. We see Evan scratch \u201cI am bored\u201d into a desk in his school\u2019s library, and he returns the next day to find a response from a female student. \n \n Evan and the mystery girl scratch flirtatious messages back and forth, and Evan tries to find out who his secret pen pal is. On the final day of school, as yearbooks are being passed around for signatures, Evan\u2019s chat partner recognizes his handwriting and reveals herself. But while she does, an ominous figure emerges through a door in the background, drops a large duffel bag, and cocks an assault rifle. \n \n Viewers are then shown a shortened version of the same PSA: The message is that while viewers were distracted by Evan\u2019s romance, they neglected the warning signs of a male student in the background who reads gun-enthusiast magazines, searches for gun videos on YouTube, and is bullied in the school\u2019s halls. Towards the end of the PSA, viewers see the male student make a menacing gesture towards his teacher after receiving a poor test grade. \n \n Text appears in the ad: \u201cWhile you were watching Evan, another student was showing signs of planning a shooting. But no one noticed.\u201d \n \n The ad says, \u201cGun violence is preventable when you know the signs.\u201d \n \n \u201cThe PSA demonstrates how easy it is for one to overlook the signs of an at-risk individual demonstrating signs of violence, particularly gun violence, and that when one knows the signs, it can be prevented,\u201d says a statement from Sandy Hook Promise. \n \n The organization hopes the PSA will teach people how to recognize someone exhibiting at-risk behaviors and empower them to intervene. \n \n Sandy Hook Promise states that 80 percent of school shooters and 70 percent of individuals who killed themselves told someone of their violent plans prior to taking action \u2014 yet nobody intervened. ||||| What Would You Do: Mother Uses Harsh Punishments on Son | What Would You Do? | WWYD \n \n - Duration: 7:22. \n \n What Would You Do? \n \n 22,198,732 views ||||| The onset of this PSA from Sandy Hook Promise, an organization created in the wake of the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in Newtown, Connecticut, begins innocently enough. The video follows a boy, Evan (the same name as the video), exchanging messages on a desk in the school library with an unknown classmate. \n \n The flirtatious messages are sent back and forth until the end of the school year, leaving a dissuaded Evan without a chance to learn the identity of his secret crush. However, in a last-ditch effort to learn who the person is, he exchanges yearbook signatures with classmates \u2014 one of which recognizes his handwriting from the desk. \n \n While the two begin talking, however, an ominous figure emerges from the entrance of the building, taking out an assault rifle and cocks the gun as the screen fades to black. \n \n \"While you were watching Evan, another student was showing signs of planning a shooting,\" the corresponding text reads. \"But no one noticed.\" \n \n The PSA then relays the scenes of Evan at school, and in the background are several alarming signs of another student looking at gun videos on YouTube, being bullied by classmates, sharing photos with a gun on Instagram and reading a gun enthusiast magazine. \n \n Giphy The warning signs \n \n \"It's important to know that one warning sign on its own does not mean a person is planning an act of violence,\" the Sandy Hook Promise website reads under the \"Know the Signs\" program. \"But when many connected or cumulative signs are observed over a period of time, it could mean that the person is heading down a pathway towards violence or self-harm. By knowing the signs, you have the power to intervene and get help for that person. Your actions can save lives.\" \n \n The organization was founded by several family members whose children were killed in the Sandy Hook Elementary School mass shooting in 2012. The nonprofit's goal is to protect children from gun violence. \n \n Watch the powerful PSA from Sandy Hook Promise below: ||||| Sandy Hook Promise is a national non-profit organization founded and led by several family members whose loved ones were killed at Sandy Hook Elementary School on December 14, 2012. \n \n Based in Newtown, Connecticut, our intent is to honor all victims of gun violence by turning our tragedy into a moment of transformation by providing programs and practices that protect children and prevent the senseless, tragic loss of life.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Meet Evan. He's a bored high school kid who starts defacing school property, er, doodling on a table in the library one day. Someone writes back. Messages are swapped as days pass, mystery and romance bloom. Evan wanders the halls, eyeing his classmates, wondering who his mystery penpal is, and as AdWeek puts it, \"there ensues a back-and-forth that's pretty captivating. Perhaps too captivating.\" (To avoid spoilers, stop reading and watch the video.) The end result has been described as \"jarring\" (Kansas City Star), \"chilling\" (Mic), and \"powerful\" (People). While you and Evan are busy being captivated\u2014especially as Evan meets his mystery penpal\u2014one of Evan's classmates is lurking in the background providing warning signs that he's planning a shooting, which in fact interrupts that very meeting we've been waiting for. The ad comes courtesy of Sandy Hook Promise, run by family of the victims of the school shooting in Newtown, Conn. \"When you don't know what to look for, or can't recognize what you are seeing, it can be easy to miss warning signs or dismiss them as unimportant,\" says Nicole Hockley, whose 6-year-old son, Dylan, died in the massacre. The organization, which says 80% of shooters tell someone what they're planning, aims to shine a light on the need to watch for those signs.

        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Roland Bosee Jr., 68, and Nino Esposito, 78, have been inseparable since they first met in 1970. \"You meet someone and it just clicks,\" Esposito told the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette last month. So with the SCOTUS decision over the summer to legalize gay marriage, the men looked forward to finally tying the knot. But one issue is holding them back: Esposito is technically Bosee's father, because he adopted him in 2012. \"We thought never in our lifetime\u2014or in 20 lifetimes\u2014...same-sex marriage [would] happen,\" Bosee said, adding to CNN that the adoption \"gave us the most legitimate thing available to us\" at the time. Even though they petitioned to have the adoption annulled, Allegheny County Judge Lawrence O'Toole \u2014known for being progressive on LGBT issues\u2014rejected that plea, noting that adoptions are typically only dissolved when fraud is involved and that nixing theirs \"would place in jeopardy and imperil adoption decrees generally.\" Adoptions of this sort are often sought to cement legal status for financial and other reasons, as well as to strengthen emotional ties. The men said it was both: Esposito told the Post-Gazette \"we felt we lacked a family of our own,\" but they also discovered that any money they inherited from each other would be subject to a much greater inheritance tax if they weren't considered relatives. One person on the couple's side: Pennsylvania Sen. Bob Casey, who tells the Post-Gazette, \"I wasn't aware that LGBT couples were turning to this method. I can't even imagine having to get an adoption petition approved \u2026 to visit a loved one in the hospital.\" Casey has written a letter of support to AG Loretta Lynch, asking her office to \"consider issuing guidance\" in cases like this; her office is reviewing it, a rep tells CNN.

Deondra Brown, co-founder of the Foundation for Survivors of Abuse, supported the bill. Keith Brown, who molested his daughters, was sentenced in 2011. Rep. Ken Ivory and Sen. Aaron Osmond sponsored the bill. Sen. Scott Jenkins and Sen. Gene Davis opposed it. The bill passed with a 24-2 vote. Michael Layne Williamson was sentenced by Judge Thomas Willmore to 1-15 years for sexual abuse.",
        "Document": "SALT LAKE CITY \u2014 The Utah Legislature passed a bill Wednesday that eliminates the statute of limitations for lawsuits against perpetrators of child sexual abuse. \n \n Deondra Brown, co-founder of the nonprofit Foundation for Survivors of Abuse, watched from the Senate gallery as lawmakers engaged in a final debate before voting to pass HB277 and sending it to Gov. Gary Herbert for his signature. \n \n \u201cOn behalf of victims across the state of Utah, we\u2019re excited to know that we can kind of breathe, take our time in healing, and come forward and tackle that big legal case when and if we are every ready,\u201d Brown said. \n \n Brown has followed the progress of HB277 and testified in favor of the bill at committee meetings throughout the legislative process. Three Brown sisters, members of the 5 Browns piano quintet, were molested by their father, Keith Brown, as children. The sisters sought criminal charges in 2010 against their father, who had also been their professional manager. \n \n Keith Brown was sentenced in March 2011 to 10 years to life for sodomy on a child, a first-degree felony, and one to 15 years each on two counts of sex abuse of a child, a second-degree felony. The crimes occurred when the girls were 13 years old or younger. \n \n Current Utah law limits civil actions to four years after a victim\u2019s 18th birthday. HB277 would remove those limitations and allow victims time to heal and muster the courage and maturity to take civil action and hold their abusers accountable, said bill sponsor Rep. Ken Ivory, R-West Jordan. \n \n \u201cSomeone that victimizes a child should never be able to hide behind time \u2014 ever,\u201d Ivory said. \n \n The bill\u2019s floor sponsor, Sen. Aaron Osmond, R-South Jordan, said 1 in 6 boys and 1 in 4 girls in Utah will suffer or have suffered from sexual abuse. He added that most children who are sexually abused don\u2019t come to a realization or the ability to deal with the experience until after age 40. \n \n The bill gives victims a four-year window from the time of discovery or remembrance of the child abuse experience to file civil action, Osmond said, allowing them to overcome emotional obstacles that often bar them from taking action. \n \n As a result, perpetrators could be susceptible to lawsuits for crimes committed years ago, Ivory said. \n \n Sen. Scott Jenkins, R-Plain City, argued against HB277, saying the statute of limitations was put in place for a reason and citing cases where individuals who realized repressed memories of child sexual abuse, but later discovered them to be wrong. He said he\u2019s \u201cnot for abuse by any means,\u201d but he\u2019s concerned about what the bill would allow. \n \n Sen. Gene Davis, D-Salt Lake City, joined Jenkins in voting against the bill. \n \n After the Senate\u2019s vote, Deondra Brown said victims of child sexual abuse shouldn\u2019t have a \u201cdoor closed in their face\u201d because of time limits, and they should be granted the option if or when they decide they want to file civil actions against perpetrators. \n \n She said victims deal with medical bills and health issues for \u201cthe rest of their lives\u201d and shouldn\u2019t have to shoulder the burden of paying for it, which she said costs the average victim up to $1 million over the course of their lives. \n \n Victims should be allowed to pursue a case that would hold the perpetrator accountable and relieve that financial burden, Deondra Brown said. \n \n \u201cThey\u2019re the ones that inflicted this upon us to begin with,\u201d she said. \n \n When asked if she would consider civil action against her father, Deondra Brown said she had talked about a civil case several years ago with her siblings, but they felt as though they \u201cwere able to get the case that (they) needed though the criminal side of things.\" \n \n \u201cBut honestly, I don\u2019t know where I would be 10 years from now if that\u2019s something I would still like to be able to explore,\u201d she said. \u201cI\u2019d love to be able to have that option in the state of Utah.\u201d \n \n The Senate's final vote on the bill was 24-2. \n \n Email: kmckellar@deseretnews.com ||||| RANDOLPH, Rich County \u2014 Under strong words from a judge and years of pain from his former student, a retired Rich High School teacher has been sentenced to prison for sexually assaulting the woman 22 years ago. \n \n Michael Layne Williamson, 60, spoke of shame, pain and forgiveness as he appeared before 1st District Judge Thomas Willmore for sentencing on July 27. The former teacher pleaded guilty to two counts of aggravated sexual abuse of a child, one second-degree felony, while the other was reduced to a third-degree felony. \n \n No details of the case were released when Williamson was originally charged in November, and requests by the Deseret News to the Rich County sheriff's and attorney's offices for police documents were denied. Inquiries about appealing the denial were ignored. \n \n In an audio recording of Williamson's sentencing hearing, the judge \u2014 unmoved by Williamson's apologies and scolding him for calling his actions a mistake \u2014 sentenced the former teacher to one to 15 years, with an additional term of up to five years to run concurrently. While in prison he must complete a sex offender course. \n \n A pre-sentence report had recommended 210 days in jail for Williamson, his attorneys explained, asking that he be able to serve his time in home confinement as he battles stage 4 prostate cancer. Prosecutors did not ask for a specific punishment for Williamson, saying they left the decision to the judge's discretion. \n \n Willmore scoffed at the short recommended sentence, which he attributed to the Justice Reinvestment Initiative and efforts to reduce prison populations. He based his sentence on the girl's young age, the position of trust that Williamson held, and the way he disgraced the \"noble profession\" of a teacher. \n \n Reading from an apology letter describing the remorse and shame that he, too, has lived with, Williamson said in the hearing, \"This indiscretion of mine was of the most heinous type.\" \n \n Willmore interrupted at that moment. \n \n \"Let me stop you right there. It is not an indiscretion. You broke the law. And I heard from many of these letters from your family that it was a mistake,\" the judge said. \n \n \"A mistake means unintended consequences or a lapse of judgement,\" he continued, pounding his hand for emphasis. \"That's far beyond a lack of judgment and indiscretion. You and your family tried to sweep this under the rug, tried to downplay this.\" \n \n In an emotional testimony, the woman, now 35, showed the judge a picture of herself in eighth grade to reinforce that it wasn't an adult who was victimized, it was a child. \n \n \"You pushed forward little by little until I was so deep in that there was no way out. You were my teacher, my friend's dad, an adult, all of those people I was taught to respect and to listen to and to trust,\" the woman said. \"You used all of it to satisfy your own perverted desires. You made sure I knew how much I would ruin everyone's life and everything around me if I ever told anyone. You made sure I knew how much you stood to lose if anyone ever found out. \n \n \"You put it all on my shoulders, those of a 13-year-old, to carry. I always blamed myself.\" \n \n The woman, who the Deseret News has chosen not to name, explained that she kept her silence about what happened between her and her teacher, eventually leaving the state. On a recent trip back to Utah, however, the pain came rushing back, and she said she made a choice: Report the abuse to law enforcement or take her own life. \n \n \"Since breaking my silence I have attempted to begin processing everything I have pushed aside for two decades,\" she said, describing the blame, anger, hurt and embarrassment she long believed was of her own making. \"I am 35 years old and I am now just starting to understand those things are a reflection of you and not me.\" \n \n Among the greatest challenges since coming forward, the woman said, has been battling the panic she now feels seeing her own children go to school or activities knowing that she, at their age, was not safe. \n \n \"With my knowledge of the evil that is out there, I feel helpless in protecting them when I couldn't even protect myself,\" she said. \"So many times I have broken down crying when I am talking to my kids about boundaries and how to keep their bodies safe, telling them that no matter what anyone else tells them it is not their fault.\" \n \n In his statement, Williamson apologized to the court, the community, his church and the school district. He called on the woman and her family to do what he called one of the hardest things they may ever face: forgive him. \n \n \"I am so sorry for the pain and anguish I have caused you,\" he said, calling the woman by name. \"I sincerely apologize for every out-of-line thought, action and deed which I committed. I truly wished you no harm and had no intention of hurting you so severely. I was reckless with our student-teacher relationship and ignored the values and principles that I truly believe in and cherish.\" \n \n In several moments, Williamson spoke of his faith in God and his belief that forgiveness is possible. \n \n \"The future is ahead and the past is in the past,\" Williamson concluded. \"My hope and prayer is that through these proceedings we can all find closure and live courageously into life ahead. Our lives and our families have been irreversibly changed by my actions of 20 years ago. My earnest prayer is that all of us can move forward from this spot and create our own personal future full of love, forgiveness and healing.\" \n \n Email: mromero@deseretnews.com, Twitter: McKenzieRomero",

The woman came forward last year and told police that former teacher Michael Layne Williamson, 60, had repeatedly assaulted her over a period of years. He was sentenced to one to 15 years in prison by a judge who berated him for disgracing the \"noble profession\" of teaching. Williamson, who pleaded guilty in May to aggravated sexual abuse of a child and another count of attempted sexual abuse, apologized in court. \"This indiscretion of mine was of the most heinous type,\" he said. \"Let me stop you right there,\" retorted Judge Thomas WIllmore. \"It is not an indiscretion.

David Morse Rice, a drifter and unemployed steelworker, was found guilty of those killings. \n \n Anti-Semitic incidents and online harassment rising, ADL says \n \n The ADL said the attack Saturday comes at a time when both anti-Semitic incidents and online harassment are on the rise. \n \n Jewish people were the victims of more reported hate crimes than any other religious minority in 2016, according to the most recent year of FBI statistics. \n \n In that year , 684 anti-Jewish incidents were reported. That's more than the rest of religiously motivated hate crimes combined, records reveal. \n \n Tracking such crimes can be nuanced and difficult. The motivations aren't always clear, and the crimes are often not reported by victims and police. \n \n Robert Bowers, 46, faces 29 charges in all, including 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder and multiple counts of two hate crimes: obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in death and obstruction of exercise of religious beliefs resulting in bodily injury to a public safety officer. \n \n \"The crimes of violence are based upon the federal civil rights laws prohibiting hate crimes,\" US Attorney Scott W. Brady and Bob Jones, FBI special agent in charge of Pittsburgh office, said in a statement. \n \n The FBI, which calls an offense a hate crime when there's an added element of bias, is leading the investigation into the attack. \n \n Bowers told a SWAT officer that he wanted all Jews to die and also that Jews were committing genocide to his people, according to CNN affiliate WTAE, citing a police criminal complaint filed Saturday evening in Pittsburgh. \n \n Last year, The Anti-Defamation League reported, anti-Semitic incidents rose almost 60% , the largest single-year increase on record. \n \n The ADL found 1,986 cases of harassment, vandalism or physical assaults against Jewish people or institutions in 2017. It found 1,267 in 2016. \n \n \"We're definitely in a period in our country where there's a general decrease in civility,\" Aryeh Tuchman, associate director for the ADL's Center on Extremism, said when the ADL released its findings in February. \"People in the past who have tamped down their anti-Semitic proclivities may feel more liberated to express them than before.\" \n \n 'An escalating scourge of hate-based violence' \n \n In a statement condemning the Pittsburgh attack, the Rabbinical Assembly said the shooting was a reminder that anti-Semitism \"is on the rise in America at a rate unprecedented in decades.\" \n \n \"This vicious hate crime, perpetrated against innocent people at prayer is but the latest in an escalating scourge of hate-based violence in America,\" it said. \n \n Moishe Bane, president of the Orthodox Union, expressed heartbreak for \"the senseless murder of our fellow Jews and all victims of vicious hate crimes.\" \n \n \"We condemn the dangerous rhetoric that foments such senseless violence and we stand with the Tree of Life Congregation and the whole Pittsburgh community at this terrible time,\" he said. \n \n Rabbi Elazar Muskin, president of the Rabbinical Council of America said \"fringe elements of society\" had become \"emboldened by speech which is often disrespectful and hateful.\" \n \n FBI says reports of hate crimes have increased \n \n The FBI showed an overall increase in reported hate crimes of more than 4% from 2015 to 2016. \n \n Anti-Islamic (anti-Muslim) crimes accounted for 307, up 19% from the previous year.

(AP Photo/Gene J. Puskar) (Associated Press) \n \n PITTSBURGH (AP) \u2014 During the week, anyone who wanted to get inside Pittsburgh's Tree of Life synagogue had to ring the doorbell and be granted entry by staff because the front door was kept locked. Not so on Saturday \u2014 the Jewish Sabbath \u2014 when the building was open for worship. \n \n A gunman who had expressed hatred of Jews exploited that vulnerability, so common in so many houses of worship across the country, in a singularly horrific way. \n \n Armed with a rifle and three handguns, Robert Bowers walked into the synagogue during Saturday morning worship and began shooting, killing 11 and wounding six before police took him into custody, officials said. It was the deadliest attack on Jews in U.S. history, according to the leader of the Anti-Defamation League. \n \n Bowers traded gunfire with police and was shot multiple times but survived. He was charged late Saturday with 29 federal counts, including weapons offenses and hate crimes. Law enforcement officials planned to discuss the massacre at a news conference Sunday morning. \n \n Four police officers were among the wounded. \n \n The nation's latest mass shooting drew condemnation and expressions of sympathy from politicians and religious leaders of all stripes. With the midterm election just over a week away, it also reignited a longstanding and bitter debate over guns. President Donald Trump said the outcome might have been different if the synagogue \"had some kind of protection\" from an armed guard, while Pennsylvania's Democratic Gov. Tom Wolf, up for re-election, noted that once again \"dangerous weapons are putting our citizens in harm's way.\" \n \n Calling the shooting an \"evil anti-Semitic attack,\" Trump ordered flags at federal buildings throughout the U.S. to be flown at half-staff in respect for the victims. He said he planned to travel to Pittsburgh, but offered no details. \n \n In the city, thousands gathered for a vigil Saturday night. Some blamed the slaughter on the nation's political climate. \n \n \"When you spew hate speech, people act on it. Very simple. And this is the result. A lot of people dead. Senselessly,\" said Stephen Cohen, co-president of New Light Congregation, which rents space at Tree of Life. \n \n The shooting raised immediate alarm in Jewish communities around the country. Authorities in New York City, Los Angeles, Chicago, Houston, Philadelphia and other cities sent extra patrols to synagogues and other houses of worship. \n \n Little was known about Bowers, who had no apparent criminal record but who is believed to have expressed virulently anti-Semitic views on social media. Authorities said it appears he acted alone. \n \n Worshippers \"were brutally murdered by a gunman targeting them simply because of their faith,\" said Bob Jones, head of the FBI's Pittsburgh office, though he cautioned the shooter's full motive was not yet known. \n \n Scott Brady, the chief federal prosecutor in western Pennsylvania, pledged that \"justice in this case will be swift and it will be severe.\" \n \n It wasn't clear if Bowers had an attorney to speak on his behalf. \n \n The gunman targeted a building that housed three separate congregations, all of which were conducting Sabbath services when the attack began just before 10 a.m. in the tree-lined residential neighborhood of Squirrel Hill, about 10 minutes from downtown Pittsburgh and the hub of Pittsburgh's Jewish community. \n \n The synagogue door was unlocked on the Sabbath \"because people are coming for services, and the bell would be ringing constantly. So they do not lock the door, and anybody can just walk in,\" said Marilyn Honigsberg, administrative assistant for New Light. \"And that's what this man did.\" \n \n Michael Eisenberg, the immediate past president of the Tree of Life, said synagogue officials had not gotten any threats that he knew of before the shooting. But he said security was a concern, and the synagogue had started working to improve it. \n \n \"You know, you're always worried that something would happen,\" said Myron Snider, head of the cemetery committee for New Light. Snider just got out of the hospital on Thursday and missed Saturday's service. \n \n \"But you never dream that it would happen like this,\" Snider added. \"Just never ever dream that it would happen like this.\" \n \n Zachary Weiss, 26, said his father, 60-year-old Stephen Weiss, was inside the synagogue but was unharmed. Weiss said his father told him that he and Tree of Life's rabbi helped congregants take shelter and follow the active shooter response training they'd received months earlier. Stephen Weiss made it out of the building and used a janitor's cellphone to call his family at home. \n \n The attack, his son vowed, \"will not define our congregation and will not define our city.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Breed reported from Raleigh, North Carolina, and Lauer reported from Philadelphia.

While the Tree of Life synagogue required guests to ring a bell to gain access during the week, on the Jewish Sabbath the building was open to all guests for Shabbat services. The Post quotes the FBI special agent in charge as saying it was \"the most horrific crime scene I\u2019ve seen in 22 years.\" Federal hate crime charges were filed against Bowers on Saturday: 29 charges in all, including 11 counts of using a firearm to commit murder.

        "Summary": "Love bombing is a grooming tactic using flattery and praise to manipulate victims. Predators combine it with intermittent reinforcement, creating dependency and trauma bonds. This tactic is effective on those seeking external validation, especially children of narcissistic parents vulnerable to emotional predators. The article highlights the overlap between love bombing in abusive relationships and cult behavior, drawing parallels with Stockholm Syndrome and the small kindness perception. It also discusses triangulation, superficial alliances, toxic affection, manipulation, and control in relationships.",
        "Document": "What is love bombing? \n \n Love bombing is a process of grooming in which a predator uses flattery, praise and the promise of a supreme alliance to fulfill their own agendas. By love bombing their victims, abusers are able to persuade their targets to fulfill their requests and desires. Love bombing is not only a tool used by covert manipulators to exploit their victims, it is also used in cults to ensure loyalty to the cult leader. In fact, there is much overlap between the behavior of cults and the abuse cycle of an abuser and his or her victim. \n \n While anyone can be the victim of love bombing, it has an especially powerful effect on children of narcissistic parents, because they have already been subconsciously programmed to seek approval, engage in people-pleasing habits and look for external validation as a way to survive their psychologically turbulent childhoods. \n \n When children of narcissists meet emotional predators in adulthood, they are especially susceptible to becoming ensnared in the web of a malignant narcissist. \n \n Love Bombing and Intermittent Reinforcement Work Together to Create an Environment of Uncertainty, Coercion and Control \n \n In a relationship with a pathological predator, love bombing is combined with intermittent reinforcement to create a sense of instability and longing in the victim. Intermittent reinforcement (in the context of psychological abuse) is a pattern of cruel, callous treatment mixed in with periodic affection. The abuser hands out \u201crewards\u201d such as affection, a compliment, or gifts sporadically and unpredictably throughout the abuse cycle. This causes the victim to perpetually seek their approval while settling for the crumbs of their occasional positive behavior. \n \n As author Adylen Birch writes, \u201cCreating fear of losing the relationship \u2013 and then relieving it periodically with episodes of love and attention \u2013 is the perfect manipulation.\u201d Much like the way a gambler at a slot machine becomes addicted to playing the game for a potential win despite the risk of major loss, a victim in the abuse cycle can become attached to the idea of getting a return on their \u201cinvestment\u201d in the relationship despite the toll it takes on their well-being. \n \n Intermittent reinforcement also affects our feelings towards our perpetrators, paradoxically bonding us more deeply to them and causing us to perceive their rare positive behaviors in an amplified way. Dr. Carver describes this as the \u201csmall kindness perception.\u201d As he notes in his article, \u201cLove and Stockholm Syndrome\u201d: \n \n In threatening and survival situations, we look for evidence of hope \u2013 a small sign that the situation may improve. When an abuser/controller shows the victim some small kindness, even though it is to the abusers benefit as well, the victim interprets that small kindness as a positive trait of the captor\u2026In relationships with abusers, a birthday card, a gift (usually provided after a period of abuse), or a special treat are interpreted as not only positive, but evidence that the abuser is not \u201call bad\u201d and may at some time correct his/her behavior. Abusers and controllers are often given positive credit for not abusing their partner, when the partner would have normally been subjected to verbal or physical abuse in a certain situation.\u201d \n \n Targets of emotional and psychological violence seek the love bombing that was so nourishing in the idealization phase, even as they are now being devalued and discarded by their abusers. This is not surprising, since love bombing, intermittent reinforcement and the effects of trauma work together to strengthen an intense trauma bond between target and abuser. \n \n There are three ways children of narcissists, who grow up scapegoated and diminished, are vulnerable to the tactics of love bombing. I discuss them below, as well as some \u201cimmunity methods\u201d to resist these manipulation tactics. \n \n 1. While hypercriticism puts us on the defensive, love-bombing disarms us initially. It mirrors our deepest desires to be wanted, desired, loved, cared for, heard and seen for who we truly are, down to every little nuance and quirk. \n \n When we are love bombed, there is an immediate sense of belonging and of kinship, something that is very attractive to children of narcissists, who feel very much like outcasts in their families as well as society. \n \n Narcissists and sociopaths are very good at \u201chooking\u201d us by pointing out our desirable physical attributes, personality traits, and/or accomplishments that deep down we want admired and recognized. At the same time, they fixate on those traits to further their own agenda, not because they actually care to know us deeply. They dig deep when they have to in order to get what they want (praise in return, sex, money, a place to live, etc.), but their affection for us is often short-lived and transient, escalating to contempt and envy should we ever threaten their sense of control over us. As Dr. Floyd (2013) writes: \n \n \u201cLove bombing is an extreme example of something that turns out to be relatively common\u2014something I call \u201ctoxic affection.\u201d If affection is the expression of love and fondness, then toxic affection is any such expression that has an ulterior motive. Perhaps I say I love you because I really do, and I want you to know that. Or, perhaps I say it only because I want to sleep with you, want to borrow money from you, or just want you to say it back to me. Using affection as a form of persuasion is often successful for the same reason that love bombing is: we want and need to be loved.\u201d \n \n Immunity method: Seek internal validation for those traits that you\u2019ve been love bombed with in the past. It\u2019s not that you don\u2019t embody what the predator has flattered you with, but that you no longer need to depend on them for your sole source of self-esteem. Surround yourself with healthy people who recognize, rather than exploit, those qualities in you. Genuine compliments are given freely, without a need for you to do something in return or be a certain way for a person. Be alert to over the top flattery merged with a request and unwarranted praise. Even if the praise does seem warranted, just be aware that some (but certainly not all) praise has a hidden purpose. \n \n 2. Since children of narcissists are often triangulated by their parents, pitted against their own siblings, they fall for predators who make them feel special and unique. \n \n This is the type of attention that children of narcissists always craved to receive in childhood and they get plenty of validation from an emotional predator that grooms them. Yet they later become retraumatized by these same manipulators when they are \u201ctriangulated\u201d with former or new harem members and lovers. This causes targets of malignant narcissists to feel even more diminished and lacking, never feeling quite \u201cenough\u201d and feeling as if they have to compete with others in order to be seen as important. \n \n Immunity method: Pinpoint what makes you irreplaceable and resist comparing yourself to others negatively. Remember that you may be seeing an abuser\u2019s new shiny target or someone they triangulated you with fresh eyes, and you are unaware of what makes you truly beautiful and outstanding. Look at yourself with fresh eyes instead \u2013 if you were an outsider looking in, what amazing traits, talents and qualities would you notice about yourself? What makes you special and unique? \n \n Cultivate an authentic relationship with what makes you stand out and embrace visibility in areas where you may have previously hidden yourself to avoid the spotlight for fear of punishment or reprisal. Bring in healthier social feedback when needed to brainstorm what those areas could be. When you have a deep inner knowing that no one could ever replace you, you don\u2019t find it necessary for someone else to make you feel that way. \n \n You can then become much more selective about who you let into your life. Manipulative, toxic people can no longer gain easy access by just being charming or sweet \u2013 they have to show up and be there for you in real ways in order for you to take them seriously. \n \n 3. We mistake superficial alliances for deep, meaningful and once-in-a-lifetime connections. \n \n Children of narcissists are forced to navigate the world alone and become their own rugged heroes. We tend to our own wounds, our own scraped knees and emotional voids due to the necessity for survival. With no supportive caretakers to mend our aches in either childhood or adulthood, we find solace in even the most superficial of connections, holding onto them for indications that we have finally found a \u201chome\u201d for our tattered hearts and weary souls. \n \n As author Peg Streep writes in \u201cWhy Unloved Daughters Fall for Narcissists,\u201d we often don\u2019t notice the red flags as much as we do the potential for connection: \n \n \u201cBecause you\u2019re so hungry for love and connection\u2014and still trying to fill the hole in your heart left by an unloving mother\u2014you\u2019re likely not to notice how he amps the volume and drama. You stay focused on the make-up sex and the warm feelings of reassurance you feel when he tells you not to worry.\u201d \n \n Unfortunately, the fast-forwarding nature of the type of relationship that has love-bombing, mixed with the intense chemistry of finally being noticed and seen, makes for a rather addictive biochemical and psychological cocktail. We become addicted to the attention because we mistake it for authentic connection. \n \n Immunity method: Differentiate between connection and flattery early on to avoid investing in people who may not have your best interests at heart. Assess which relationships and friendships in your life have the capacity to grow into deeper alliances and which ones fall short of authentic partnership and true compatibility. The former usually takes some time to build and is built over time with someone who is trustworthy, consistent, transparent and reliable. The latter is often a quick fix or sleight of hand, a magic show followed by a disappearing act. \n \n Flattery, even if it is based on truly amazing qualities you might have, rarely lasts long-term. Connection, on the other hand, is built on a solid foundation \u2013 not just on empty compliments, but on genuine rapport, support, and intimacy. It involves two individuals who both share parts of themselves with vulnerability, along with a respect for personal boundaries and reciprocity. Connection, not crumbs, is what nourishes you long-term. Remember that you are truly worthy and deserving of nothing less. \n \n References \n \n Birch, A. (2016, December 18).

A surprise romantic getaway to a secluded countryside cottage for the weekend. A thoughtful phone call when you least expect it. All the signs of the beginning a of loving, caring relationship, right? \n \n Well, perhaps not. In fact, they might be signposts for the opposite, or what is commonly known as 'love bombing'. \n \n According to Dale Archer, a psychiatrist and author, 'love bombing' occurs when people are showered with over-the-top displays of attention and affection. And, we're not just talking romantic gestures and the occasional home-cooked meal, but romantic conversations, talks of the 'future' together, and constant contact via social media, phone calls and messages. The difference between a solid loving relationship and one that is subject to 'love bombing' is what happens next... \n \n ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \n \n More often than not, 'love bombing' is when these displays of 'affection' are grandiose and really over the top, leading people to quickly think they might have found their 'soul mate' or 'the one'. However, they soon find the loving, caring, affection, and understanding behaviour from their partner flips, resulting in unreasonable, controlling and manipulative traits. \n \n What is 'love bombing'? \n \n In essence, 'love bombing' is a form of conditioning tool (otherwise known as a form of abuse), whereby one person in the relationship drowns the other in displays of 'love' to maintain power and control. \n \n MOST POPULAR \n \n 'Healthy relationships build slowly, and are based on a series of actions, not a flood of words,' Archer writes for a blog post titled 'The Manipulative Partner's Most Devious Tactic' for Psychology Today. \n \n Rex Features \n \n The term is widely believed to have been first used by the Unification Church of the United States in the 1970s, whose cult leaders used love as a form of ammunition 'to con followers into committing mass suicide and murder', according to Archer. \n \n 'Pimps and gang leaders use 'love bombing' to encourage loyalty and obedience as well,' he writes. \n \n How does it work? \n \n First things first, all relationships are different and just because a partner showers you with love and affection does not mean they're narcissistic or have psychopathic tendencies that might lead to 'love bombing'. Some people genuinely are very loving and thoughtful and these sorts of gestures continue long into the relationship with no catch. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT - CONTINUE READING BELOW \n \n However, those who use 'love bombing' as a form of control often reinforce their love for their victim by showering them with affection when they act in a certain way that pleases the abuser, and later they will punish that person for behaving in a way that the abuser doesn't like. \n \n For example, an abuser will post an adorable snap of the two of you at dinner to Facebook, for all to see, with an equally mushy caption about how much you mean to him and how happy he is to be spending the evening with a gorgeous creature like you. The same person, though, when you head out for a dinner without him or go to a club with your friends, will call you ten times and accuse you of cheating/abandoning/not caring enough about him. \n \n ''Love bombing' works because humans have a natural need to feel good about who we are, and often we can't fill this need on our own,' writes Archer. \n \n How do you spot 'love-bombing'? \n \n Getting butterflies, falling head-over-heels, and feeling like you're falling madly in love with a new boyfriend/girlfriend is very normal in the early months of a relationship. \n \n But, according to Archer, potential love bombing victims often find themselves trapped into having constant contact with a partner, which ultimately convinces them the intensity of the communication is a sign of success and love.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Love at first sight may actually be a warning sign. That's according to experts cautioning people in new relationships about so-called \"love bombing.\" Not familiar with the term? Elle UK \"delve[s] into the worrying behaviors of a 'love bomber,'\" explaining that it takes time for people to truly get to know each other as their relationships deepen. When someone is over-the-top awesome in the beginning of a relationship\u2014always sending flowers and offering up compliments and affection\u2014it could actually be a \"conditioning tool (otherwise known as a form of abuse).\" PsychCentral calls it a \"process of grooming.\" Constant flowers themselves aren't the worrisome sign\u2014the shift is; ie, if the attention goes from positive and affectionate to controlling and cruel. If the person being \"bombed\" falls fast and hard it can be harder to see that shift. Love bombers, by the way, are narcissists, and they're usually men. In Psychology Today, psychiatrist Dale Archer dates the term \"love bombing\" to the 1970s, when Unification Church of the United States (aka the \"Moonies\") first used it. Cult leaders like David Koresh and Charles Manson would employ this tactic to woo followers and then con them into nefarious acts. Archer argues that idealization isn't necessarily harmful when it grows over time, but that the \"common thread\" in love bombing is intense courtship and idealization over just a matter of days or weeks. Soon, \"love bombers exploit the natural human need for self worth, and turn it into shame, regret, and self-loathing.\" (One study finds that men tend to feel more entitled and be more narcissistic than women.)"

        "Summary": "Verizon's shared data plans pool data for all devices, including unlimited voice and text messages. The article examines cost implications, noting potential savings for families but higher costs for individuals due to access fees. With 4G LTE increasing data usage, these plans may not benefit all users. Verizon's ARPU measurement changes, and existing customers must upgrade to new plans, losing unlimited data. Sprint and T-Mobile offer alternative plans, and subsidized phones are affected.",
        "Document": "Consumers screamed for it. Verizon answered. Later this month, the U.S. cellular carrier will offer shared data plans for entire families. Instead of each device on an account being allotted its own data limit, all devices in a family plan will draw from the same data pool. Verizon boasts that it listened to consumers and responded with an innovative service. But when it comes to the bottom line, is Verizon doing American families any favors? \n \n Our Family of Four \n \n ReadWriteWeb discussed the feasibility of shared data plans last year. Let\u2019s bring back our theoretical family of four and apply the shared data rates Verizon announced today. \n \n This theoretical upper-middle-class family has a mother, a father and two children. Both Ma and Pa have a smartphone and a tablet. The teenage kids each have a smartphone and share a tablet between them. The total is seven devices that under the old system would have required seven different data plans. \n \n Cost: $299.97 on the middle tier of Verizon\u2019s current family plan (AT&T, Sprint and T-Mobile rates are slightly different): \n \n four lines with 700 talk minutes: $119.97 \n \n four smartphones with 2GB monthly data: $120 \n \n three tablets with 1GB monthly data: $60 \n \n Note: Cost estimates are before taxes and fees attached by the carriers and individual states. \n \n Focusing on the data aspect of the current family plan, that is 11GB of data for $180. Verizon points out that with the new shared plan, you pay a lot less for the data. The problem? You pay more per device. \n \n This is the pricing chart that Verizon announced today. \n \n Verizon's shared data plans are available on June 28. \n \n Let\u2019s run the numbers for our theoretical family. \n \n four smartphones with unlimited minutes: $160 \n \n three tablets: $30 \n \n 10GB monthly shared data plan: $100 \n \n In aggregate, the shared data plan comes in at $290, about $10 less than the current Verizon family plan. The family also loses 1GB of data. If we add it back as an overage charge (where the family exceeds its monthly allotment and is charged $10 for every additional GB), then the plans are exactly the same. \n \n Does this surprise anyone? Verizon's new plan does not give families a discount. The difference amounts to an administrative change in how Verizon gauges use within a family plan, not a change in how much it charges or the revenue it generates. \n \n Convenience and Choice \n \n Let\u2019s go back to our theoretical family. Last fall, we imagined that the father was a low-volume data user (to Dad, the smartphone is really just a phone) while the mother traveled a lot and was a high-volume user. Mom streams movies from Netflix, catches up on shows with Hulu Plus and listens to a lot of Pandora and talk radio with Stitcher. She just loves everything these mobile devices can do and hardly gives a thought to the amount of data she uses. The teenage kids take a lot of pictures, text and use social networks. They watch the occasional movie and a lot of YouTube. All in all, the kids are fairly normal smartphone users. \n \n Without a shared data plan, Dad\u2019s allotment of data pretty much goes to waste. Activities like checking and sending email on your phone take up very little data. The family is punished financially for Mom\u2019s freewheeling ways. So, if we break it down, the family on the shared data plan is actually being far more efficient with their allotment than each individual would be on their own. \n \n This has several benefits for both the consumer and the carrier. Individual consumers, on average, use about 2.2GB of data a month on their smartphones. Under many contracts, such as AT&T\u2019s 3GB for $30, they are paying for data they do not use. In the new Verizon system, those users would be punished for going over their 2GB allowance. \n \n For the carrier, the shared data plan represents a change in how consumers are measured. In the old family plan, a company like Verizon would measure average revenue per user (ARPU). In the shared data plan scenario, the measurement structure changes. The family, instead of being measured as a group of individuals, becomes a unit. When an individual uses more data in a given month, the ARPU for that person goes down. When taken as a unit, an individual\u2019s excess data use gets rolled into a lump sum without damaging (or theoretically, enhancing) Verizon\u2019s ARPU. \n \n Think of your family and ask yourself: What is easier? Is it better to collect family members under one lump-sum plan or keep them partitioned to their own personal data limits? That is really what it comes down to. Verizon is going to make the same amount of money either way. Let us know in the comments what approach your family is going to take. ||||| Individuals end up paying more as Verizon now forces unlimited voice and text messages -- even if they don't want them. \n \n (Credit: Jessica Dolcourt/CNET) \n \n Verizon Wireless' newly unveiled \"Share Everything\" plan may be a revolution in the industry, but it's going to leave a lot of individual customers unhappy with the change. \n \n \"Share Everything\" allows customers for the first time to share a common bucket of data, similar to what they do with voice minutes and text messages under a family plan. The benefit comes when large families sign up for a single plan, yielding some savings. \n \n I would be fine with the changes if \"Share Everything\" was just one of many options, but it's not. The new shared data plans, which includes a fee for unlimited voice and text, and a set amount of data, as well as another separate fee for each device, has become the new status quo. If you're a new customer, you'll have to choose one of these plans starting June 28. Fortunately for existing customers, they can keep their existing plans, although they will have to give up unlimited data if they choose to upgrade to a new subsidized phone. \n \n Some people may be okay with getting unlimited access to voice and text messages, but I'm not one of them. I suspect I'm not alone. At a time when people are using data services more, which power alternative text and calling apps, they are looking to lean on voice and text messages less. That's particularly the case as many folks move to the faster 4G LTE network, which consumes data even faster. \n \n But under the change, customers will have to give up their old grandfathered unlimited data plans right as people use more data than ever. It's a classic case of a carrier giving you more of what you don't need, and taking away what you do -- all for a higher price. \n \n The plans are clearly geared towards families -- particularly ones in which a few members don't use as much data -- at the expense of individuals. An individual with a plan that consists of 450 voice minutes, 1,000 text messages, and 2 gigabytes of data currently pays $80 a month. Under the new structure, which offers unlimited voice and text messages, the price is $100. \n \n As Verizon customer, I fall under the $80 plan, and rarely ever go over my calling or text message caps. I don't particularly relish the notion of a forced \"upgrade\" to a $100 plan -- $60 for 2GB of access and unlimited voice and text messages and a $40 access fee for a smartphone -- if I move to Share Everything. \n \n For a couple, the new share plan would cost $150 for access for two smartphones, 4GB of data, and unlimited text and voice. That's not much different than a current share plan that comes with 700 minutes, 1,000 text messages per phone, and 2GB of data each. Current couples, however, would have to give up their unlimited data plans in exchange for unlimited voice and text messages. \n \n Part of the problem are the high access fees for devices, which make it tough for individuals who want to sign up multiple devices under one plan. The access fee for a smartphones is $40 a month, while a basic phone is $30, and laptops, Netbooks, and mobile hotspots are $20. Even the lowest rate -- $10 a month for a tablet -- seems excessively high. \n \n Verizon Wireless Chief Marketing Officer Tami Erwin acknowledged that some people would end up paying more under the new system, but stressed the savings that families would be obtain under the new plan. \n \n It's easy to see why Verizon wants to focus on the family. Family plans of text messages and voice service aren't new, and have been tremendously successful at keeping groups of individuals tied to a single carrier. Verizon is hoping data will add another element of stickiness -- making it hard for family members to break away and sign up for their own plan at a different carrier. \n \n \"In a world where incentives for families favor concentrating around a single provider, the biggest providers win,\" said Craig Moffett, an analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein & Co. \"In a household with two or three AT&T; or Verizon devices -- say, a smartphone and a tablet or two, and one device from T-Mobile or Sprint...Sprint doesn't stand a chance.\" \n \n The plans also open the door for AT&T; to offer an identical plan -- undoubtedly with a few slight tweaks to claim differentiation -- which is bad news for individuals on that carrier. \n \n The Verge's Chris Ziegler earlier today called the Verizon plans lackluster. I would go further and say it represents a raw deal for a lot of people. \n \n Corrected at 4:40 a.m. PT June 13: The story previously inaccurately suggested that a person upgrading a phone or changing a plan would be forced to move to a \"Share Everything\" plan. Current customers can actually keep their existing plan, although they would lose their unlimited data plan after an upgrade. ||||| Summary: I expected that carriers would not be giving anything away with shared data plans, but have to admit I am a bit disappointed that convenience comes at such a high price on Verizon. \n \n In May Verizon stated they were going to completely change their wireless plan structure and I am blown away by how fast this is now rolling out. Starting on 28 June, Verizon's new Share Everything plans are rolling out and will be the only option for customers, unless you stick with your existing plan and buy new phones at the unsubsidized pricing. The new plans give you more options, but this convenience comes at high price for individuals with minimum voice options. If you compare unlimited voice and text, then it is a good deal and for large families who all want data the plans are a great deal. \n \n The shared data plans are higher for individuals, but families who want multiple devices all with data will save quite a bit (if you want unlimited voice) with less worrying about per device data usage. A family of five will drop to $270 for five lines with a shared pool of 4GB, includes unlimited talk and text. Individuals who don't talk much on the phone, on the other hand, will see plan rates jump from the low of $69.99 (450 minutes and 2GB of data) to the lowest smartphone option of $90 for just 1GB of data. Granted these new shared plans come with unlimited voice and text messaging so if you make a lot of calls or send a lot of texts this may end up being a better option. I personally end up paying about 50 cents/minute for voice because I do not make that many calls on my mobile phone, but have to pay the minimum $40 per month. \n \n I would prefer to see wireless carriers offer compelling data only packages with per minute voice options. Like many people I see on my commute, data is used much more than voice on smartphones and voice seems to be where carriers make major profits. \n \n With these new shared plans you get unlimited voice and texts with data charged at these rates: \n \n 1 GB is $50 \n \n 2 GB is $60 \n \n 4 GB is $70 \n \n 6 GB is $80 \n \n 8 GB is $90 \n \n 10GB is $100 \n \n Monthly line access fees are as follows: \n \n $40 for a smartphone \n \n $30 for a basic feature phone \n \n $20 for USB stick, notebooks, netbooks \n \n $10 for tablets \n \n These plans also include WiFi hotspot functionality. I am not sure if things will change with the data only plans for the iPad and tablets. \n \n Given that I see excellent Verizon coverage and my daughters are getting older and heading off to college, I am considering a switch to Verizon where everyone can get data, unlimited texts, and unlimited voice minutes for a lower price than i pay even on low cost T-Mobile. \n \n If Sprint can get their LTE network up and running soon, they will look even more attractive for individual lines with their unlimited everything plans for $80 per smartphone. I am still grandfathered into unlimited data on Verizon at a total cost of $83, with taxes, and if I stick with Verizon I am going to just keep buying unsubsidized devices to take advantage of this data plan.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Verizon yesterday unveiled its new \"Share Everything\" plans, in which families will share one data allowance on a family plan rather than each member having his or her own data allowance on separate plans. Despite the fact that Verizon is touting this as a money-saving opportunity for families, critics run the numbers and say it's actually not: Dan Rowinski of ReadWriteWeb finds that one hypothetical family of four will likely pay exactly the same amount per month, or may save at most $10 per month. The problem? Data may be cheaper under the new plans, but \"you pay more per device,\" he explains. \"Verizon's new plan does not give families a discount. The difference amounts to an administrative change.\" Troy Wolverton goes a bit further in the Mercury News, calling the new plans \"a crummy deal for many consumers.\" He finds that many users will actually end up paying more, since the only real price breaks are on talk minutes and text messages\u2014\"services [consumers] are already using less.\" \"Overall, the move appears to be a price hike tarted up to look consumer friendly,\" he writes. All the critics concede that the new plans are certainly simpler to understand, but on ZDNet, Matthew Miller is \"disappointed that convenience comes at such a high price.\" If Sprint gets its LTE network running, it will be an \"attractive\" option for individual unlimited plans at $80 per phone, he notes. On CNET, Roger Cheng points out that Verizon is now \"forcing\" unlimited voice and text messages with these plans. \"Under the change, customers will have to give up their old grandfathered unlimited data plans right as people use more data than ever,\" he writes. \"It's a classic case of a carrier giving you more of what you don't need, and taking away what you do\u2014all for a higher price.\" The new plans roll out on June 28, and the only way to keep your existing plan is to upgrade to new phones at full cost, with no discount."

        "Summary": "Maria Rose Belding, an American University student, co-founded the non-profit MEANS Database with Grant Nelson. This platform, utilizing data science, connects food banks and pantries with surplus food to reduce waste and address food insecurity affecting 48 million Americans. Belding's work has earned recognition, including an award from L\u2019Oreal Paris. The MEANS Database facilitates food recovery and communication between donors and recipients, offering potential tax benefits for donors. It includes over 200 donor accounts, 10 interns, campus food pantries, and plans for a public directory, making a substantial impact in the fight against hunger.",
        "Document": "If you think young Americans are lazy, spend five minutes talking with Maria Rose Belding. \n \n The 20-year-old American University sophomore is the co-founder of MEANS Database, which connects people, organizations, and businesses with extra food with food banks and pantries that need it. In its first year, the food recovery notification system rescued about 4,000 pounds of food; became the first non-profit to win the GW New Venture Competition; and just took home a $10,000 prize from L\u2019Oreal Paris through its Women Of Worth campaign. (At the L\u2019Oreal Paris celebration event last week, Belding was the youngest of the 10 honorees.) It\u2019s also figuring out how to make enough money to become self sufficient, a rarity for non-profits. \n \n meansdatabase.com \n \n MEANS operates through both a website and an app, creating a simple system: A donor lists what\u2019s available, donees nearby get notifications, someone claims it and arranges for pick-up. As a high school freshman, Belding was volunteering at a local soup pantry in her hometown in Iowa, when she watched the director scramble to find recipients for the 10,000 boxes of macaroni and cheese a church had donated. Not everything found a home before the expiration date, and a lot ended up in the trash. \n \n In the world of food waste, this is the oft-cited paradox: There are 48 million Americans living in food insecurity, meaning that, at times during the year, these households were uncertain of having, or unable to acquire, enough food because they didn\u2019t have sufficient money or other resources. Yet Americans waste an estimated 40% of the country\u2019s food. It\u2019s not a problem of supply or demand. It\u2019s connecting the two. \n \n Hunger is a problem hitting more people than most realize, including college students. \u201cWe have several campus food pantries on MEANS,\u201d Belding tells Quartz. \u201cWe will be able to funnel food to the same kids we sit in class with.\u201d \n \n Belding\u2019s idea didn\u2019t become a reality, though, until she met her co-founder, Grant Nelson. He developed the technology while she found the donors, food banks, and pantries that would use the database. \n \n The technology and wide reach\u2014it currently has over 200 donor and recipient accounts representing more than 2,000 partner agencies and programs, spread out over 27 states\u2014are largely what makes MEANS different from other food rescue organizations. City Harvest, for example, provides a similar service in New York, rescuing a whopping 50 million pounds of food just this year. But it works at a larger scale and arranges the legwork itself, like matching and transporting donations with food kitchens that need them. The MEANS platform allows small organizations and individuals to participate on a scale that might be too small for an organization like City Harvest, but crucial to the people they help. Belding says nearly every donation finds a new home\u2014the only one she could remember that didn\u2019t was 23 individually wrapped cupcakes with a very short window of recovery time. \n \n Getty Images for L'Oreal Paris Belding strikes a pose at the L\u2019Oreal Paris Women of Worth 2015 Celebration in New York. \n \n Thanks in part to wins like the one from GW ($42,500 in cash and $20,000 in prizes) and L\u2019Oreal, MEANS now has a staff of 11 people, as well as 10 interns and volunteers. But, says Belding, \u201cI\u2019m not content to be chasing other people\u2019s money.\u201d So she and her team are working on a system to help them become less grant dependent. \n \n While large retail donors don\u2019t currently claim tax credits for their donation\u2014they\u2019re too small and localized to be worth the trouble\u2014MEANS already tracks all the information they would need. \u201dFor us, it\u2019s a matter of keystrokes,\u201d says Belding. \n \n Companies can use it to get tax benefits, while MEANS\u2014which is free for users\u2014takes a small fee. \u201dWe haven\u2019t started executing it yet, but every conversation with retailers we\u2019ve had has been, \u2018You can build that?'\u201d \n \n Next year, Belding hopes to launch that program, grow and improve the one already in place, and create a public, searchable directory of food pantries. (She\u2019s found that half the pantries she and her team have called list wrong numbers.) \n \n This week, though, Belding is focused on finals. On top of the full-time hours she puts into MEANS\u2014she didn\u2019t want to say how many because her parents will read the story\u2014she is still a student. And a very impressive one. Her report card this semester, she says, should be all As and A-minuses. \u201cThere might be a B-plus, but I\u2019m hoping not.\u201d ||||| Hear me out. \n \n I hated math in high school. In my 10th grade diary, I referred to geometry as 'a bunch of self-important shapes searching for nonexistent meaning.' (Sorry, Mr. Cutler.) At 16, I was full of sarcasm and empty of self-awareness, convinced learning trig was a waste of time and a distraction from the side project holding all my interest: trying to build a website for emergency food providers. Math felt like an exercise in frustration and wholly disconnected from trying to feed people struggling with hunger. \n \n I was wrong. \n \n I was trying to build a program that made it easier for emergency feeding systems like food pantries to communicate with each other and their donors. The idea, which I called MEANS (Matching Excess And Need for Stability), made sense in my head, but I couldn't get it to translate to a computer. That changed when I met Grant Nelson, a GWU law student who grew up 45 minutes from my Iowa hometown. A self-taught programmer, he looked at my idea and said, \"I think I can build that.\" He did. \n \n Grant became MEANS' co-founder and director of tech. He'd only been inside a food pantry once and I'd never seen real computer code. It was a huge learning curve for both of us, and one I couldn't have calculated the arc of if my life depended on it. As Grant introduced me to the concept of data science, it was clear I owed a few high school math teachers an apology. (Sorry, guys. I hope this makes up for some of the masterful eye rolls I sent your subject's way over the years.) \n \n I'm 20 now, and while my sarcasm supply is still aplenty, I've done a 180 on how I feel about math. (See what I did there?) There are now 11 young people, age 18 to 27, on Team MEANS, and we're working with hundreds of users representing thousands of programs and partnerships to reduce food waste and hunger at the same time. We're using a whole lot of math to do it, from tackling big data to determine the food pantries most likely to need and use MEANS to developing a public directory of emergency food resources around the country. It was because of meticulous record-keeping and data science that we discovered that as many as 50% of online listings for emergency food providers have incorrect contact information, and it is through coding and more data science that we're working to fix it. Math isn't the problem I thought it was - it's the solution. \n \n MEANS is an incredibly simple idea. Food pantries tell our system where they are, what they need and how far they're willing to travel to get it. The same platform allows pantries to notify their neighbor agencies when they're overwhelmed with a too-large donation, with traditional donors like grocery stores and restaurants able to use the same website to get food into the hands of the hungry. Our concept is simple and the execution extraordinarily complicated. Without math and its cooler cousin data science, we could have never brought MEANS to life. \n \n Math matters, for developing strategy, discovering the big picture and daring to think as differently as we have about hunger and food waste. Math can draw us a map of where to go next and numbers can lead us down paths we never considered before. There is too much need in this world to be focused solely on doing good - we have to also focus on doing that good well. Hunger is an enormous problem, and with 48 million Americans struggling to put food on the table, we need absolutely every tool we can find to build smart, sustainable solutions. MEANS lives in the space where empathy and entrepreneurship meet, and I'm so proud of a staff that never aims low and is always pushing for new goals. Charity can and should have a big brain to match its big heart. After all, if I remember correctly...with the right team, it's possible to build an equation where the limit does not exist. \n \n Maria Rose Belding is a (mostly) reformed high school math class nap-taker and co-founder/executive director of the MEANS Database. Now a college sophomore, Maria Rose is a nationally published writer on hunger and poverty, and the resources she developed for high schoolers tackling food insecurity are in the hands of more than a thousand students in schools in nine countries. She was recognized as a L'Or\u00e9al Paris Women of Worth in 2015 for making an extraordinary difference in her community. ||||| Maria Rose Belding and Grant Nelson founded a sprawling online network that connects thousands of food pantries in 24 states, allowing those organizations to quickly share surplus food that might have gone to waste otherwise. (Ricky Carioti/The Washington Post) \n \n One of the most profound contradictions of modern America is that more than 45 million Americans don\u2019t have enough to eat, but the country wastes an estimated 40 percent of its food. The forces fueling this paradox are complex: Grocery stores think they\u2019ll assume legal liability in donating food. Farmers allow edible, but homely fruit to rot in fear it won\u2019t sell. Bananas blacken on all our shelves. \n \n But the reasons behind this waste didn\u2019t feel so complex to a teenage girl named Maria Rose Belding on a chilly Iowa day five years ago. \n \n The whole thing felt simple. It felt wrong. It felt like something had to change. \n \n Belding, then a volunteer at a local food pantry in Pella, had just thrown out hundreds of boxes of expired mac and cheese in front of numerous people lining up outside to collect food. \n \n \u201cWe were throwing away all of this food just because we couldn\u2019t communicate,\u201d Belding, then a freshman in high school, remembers venting that day. That frustration would ultimately lead the American University sophomore to develop a groundbreaking innovation in the long \u2014 and often inefficient \u2014 war on hunger. \n \n After years of research, Belding, 20, has founded a sprawling online network that connects thousands of food pantries in 24 states, allowing them to quickly share surplus food that might have otherwise gone to waste. Pantries simply post their excess food to the program \u2014 and someone else in the network picks it up and puts it to use. The database has saved an estimated two tons of food. \n \n L\u2019Or\u00e9al Paris has since lauded the program, last week naming Belding one of its 10 women of worth. So has Arianna Huffington. And experts agree programs such as the interactive MEANS website, which stands for Matching Excess and Need for Stability, can close lapses in communication between pantries and chip away at the country\u2019s colossal problem with chronic waste. \n \n Food waste \u201cneeds to be addressed on multiple levels,\u201d said Mathy Stanislaus, a senior official with the Environmental Protection Agency who works on ending food waste. \u201cPart is wider knowledge of the problem, but also tools [like this] to reduce waste.\u201d \n \n The stakes couldn\u2019t be higher. Food production accounts for around 10 percent of the national energy budget, uses half of the country\u2019s land and consumes around 80 percent of all the freshwater used in the United States, according to a paper published in 2012 by the National Resources Defense Council. \n \n That means, the study noted, Americans squander $165 billion every year on food destined for landfills, where the decomposition of organic matter emits 16 percent of the country\u2019s methane \u2014 a greenhouse gas that\u2019s 25 times more potent than carbon dioxide. \n \n Even people who donate to their local pantries are contributing, to some degree, to the problem. Emergency food centers have long been the last stop for whatever\u2019s lurking in the back of America\u2019s cupboards. And so, people donate an endless supply of near-expired creamed corn, beans and Honeybuns. The excess of product often does one of two things. It expires on the shelf and gets thrown out. Or it clutters the pantry so much that nonprofits can\u2019t accept premium donations that could immediately serve a community. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s very common for grocers to give poorly selling products in bulk to emergency food providers,\u201d Belding said. \u201cThat\u2019s just fine. But when you get 400 jars of peanut butter and you have two weeks to get rid of them and serve 100 people a month, total, and only distribute four times a month, that rapidly becomes a problem.\u201d \n \n When Belding started researching the concept behind the MEANS database while in high school, she was sure someone had beaten her to it. But she soon realized that the emergent technologies that had upended so many industries \u2014 tools to discern opportunity in unlikely places \u2014 hadn\u2019t yet found their way to the nation\u2019s nonprofit food pantries. Around half of the phone numbers listed under food pantries, she said, didn\u2019t even work. \n \n Belding thought she might be onto something. In her mind, there was clear need for a network. And so, at the beginning of her freshman year, she arrived at a friend\u2019s house and got to talking with his 24-year-old brother, Grant Nelson. Nelson, now a third-year law student at George Washington University and program co-founder, had experience with building programs. So she asked him if he could help. \n \n He wasn\u2019t sure he wanted to. \u201cThis struck me as a changing-people\u2019s-behavior problem, rather than providing a tool to fulfill a need,\u201d he said. \u201cI said: \u2018Phones exist. Emails exist. Twitter exists. Facebook exists. What could we possibly build that would be slicker for all of the food banks and food pantries to communicate with each other that isn\u2019t already solved by something else?\u2019 \u201d \n \n In the end, he helped anyway. It took more than a year. A year of planning, researching and building program after program. Then in February, the website launched. \n \n Months passed. In May, Belding was sitting in class when she saw one of their nascent users had posted an item to the site. This was the moment, she realized, when the project would either succeed or fail. A sense of panic seized her when she saw someone was giving away assorted varieties of canned beans. \u201cThey\u2019re like the off-brand Mountain Dew in the food world,\u201d Belding said. \u201cYou\u2019ll take it only if you have no other option. . . . So we were all anxiously sitting by our computers hitting refresh, and I said, \u2018Please, someone take this.\u2019 And then, it\u2019s gone. It just disappeared. . . . The beans had moved.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe were kind of desperate,\u201d said Stephanie Shallah, an official with the District\u2019s So Others Might Eat who had posted the item. \u201cBeans come so often to me that I didn\u2019t think anyone would want them. So I said, \u2018I\u2019m going to just post it and see what happens.\u2019 I said, \u2018I have nothing to lose.\u2019 \u201d She said a Landover pantry serving a large Hispanic population took the goods. \n \n Things then happened very quickly for MEANS. The organization now commands a staff of several programmers paid through grant money and even a few interns who Belding concedes are older than she. The number of members on the site has grown from around 50 larger food banks in June to more than 200, opening up a network of thousands of smaller-shop pantries that work under the umbrella of those banks. \n \n But there\u2019s still a lot of work to do, Belding said. There are still 26 states that remain untapped. There\u2019s still the world. Belding said she had more calls to make. More connections to forge.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 There are 48 million Americans who, at some point each year, may be unable to get enough food. Meanwhile, a third of the country's food goes to waste. This isn't as easy an issue to solve as it sounds\u2014something Maria Rose Belding realized while volunteering at a soup pantry as a teen. At one point, the pantry received 10,000 boxes of mac 'n cheese, but couldn't find enough people in need before the stuff expired, reports Quartz. \"We were throwing away all of this food just because we couldn't communicate,\" Belding tells the Washington Post. Now a 20-year-old American University student, Belding hopes the app and website she co-created can help: Overflowing pantries list what extra food they have available on the MEANS (Matching Excess and Need for Stability) Database, and neighboring pantries get notifications, Belding writes at the Huffington Post. Grocery stores and restaurants with food to unload can make use of the site, too. Belding remembers watching the first donation of canned beans pop up after MEANS launched in February. \"We were all anxiously sitting by our computers hitting refresh,\" she says\u2014the anxiety intensified by the fact that beans are donated so regularly they aren't a hot commodity. Suddenly, \"it just disappeared.\" Since then, the database has kept 4,000 pounds of food from the trash. While a similar service saved 50 million pounds of food in New York in 2015 by matching donations with food kitchens, MEANS allows smaller organizations to do the ground work themselves, and currently has 200 accounts across 27 states. While grants and awards keep the site running for now, Belding has plans: to track large retailers' donations from a tax-benefit perspective, something most don't currently do since those donations are made on such a local level. MEANS would charge a small fee for doing all the tracking. (On the food front, this young chef has left one of the world's best restaurants to try to save America's school lunch program.)"

When the sale of the company is completed, expected to be in the third quarter of this year, he will receive \u201cthe agreed-upon purchase price for his share of the sale proceeds,\u201d according to the filing. \n \n Bloomberg valued the Skybridge deal at between $200 million and $230 million when it was announced in January. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s black and white that he\u2019s going to get money,\u201d said Austin Evers, executive director at American Oversight, a watchdog group that focuses on transparency in government. \n \n The SkyBridge website continues to advertise Scaramucci as the firm's managing director, despite the fact that he has been a government employee for more than a month. A SkyBridge spokeswoman said Scaramucci stepped down from the executive post Jan. 17, when the company\u2019s sale was announced. He remained an employee of the firm, collecting a salary, until starting at Ex-Im last month. \n \n The investment firm, which Scaramucci founded in 2005, is in the process of being sold to RON Transatlantic and Chinese conglomerate HNA Group. The sale, set in motion in January when Scaramucci was shedding his holdings in anticipation of landing an administration job, has drawn the scrutiny of regulators and is taking longer than expected to close. \n \n The interagency Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States is examining the deal to ensure that it carries no risk to national security. The panel\u2019s review, which comes amid ramped-up scrutiny of business dealings with China, ultimately can be overruled by President Donald Trump. \n \n Scaramucci said Friday his start date wouldn\u2019t be until August so that everything can be \u201c100 percent totally cleansed and clean and I don\u2019t see an issue with it.\u201d \n \n White House spokeswoman Natalie Strom referred questions about Scaramucci\u2019s SkyBridge investment to the Treasury. Treasury spokeswoman Marisol Garibay did not respond to requests for comment. \n \n Scaramucci, a Trump fundraiser and frequent campaign surrogate whose appointment to an administration post was delayed in part because of the complicated nature of the SkyBridge sale, joined Ex-Im in June. \n \n Ex-Im was seen as a \"very temporary move,\" a way to get the Trump loyalist to Washington until a higher-level position could be found, according to one White House adviser. \n \n The bank is across the street from the White House, where Scaramucci was free to come and go thanks to security credentials that gave him 24-hour access. That allowed him to elude the detection of senior White House staffers, including chief of staff Reince Priebus. \n \n Scaramucci has been on unpaid leave from Ex-Im since the day he started there, June 19, a bank spokeswoman said, forgoing his $172,100 salary as chief strategy officer. \n \n A friend said Scaramucci thought his stay at the bank would be longer-lived and that the White House job came unexpectedly. \n \n In his disclosure, Scaramucci listed assets worth as much as $85 million. He has several real estate investments, including single-family rental homes on Long Island. \n \n A minority stake in the New York Mets is worth as much as $5 million. He also is an investor in Juice Press, a chain of snack and smoothie shops in the Northeast. \n \n Scaramucci earned $200,000 in income from a majority stake in Hastings Capital Group, according to his financial disclosure.

He made $5 million in salary and another $4.9 million from his ownership stake in his investment firm SkyBridge Capital in the first six months of this year, according to the filing. \n \n Mr. Scaramucci responded angrily. \u201cIn light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony,\u201d he wrote on Twitter, \u201cI will be contacting @FBI and the @TheJusticeDept.\u201d \n \n He added the hashtag #swamp, reflecting President Trump\u2019s promise to drain the swamp, and then included the Twitter handle of Reince Priebus, the White House chief of staff, who opposed Mr. Scaramucci\u2019s appointment last week.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 New White House communications director Anthony Scaramucci was not happy about what he believed was a leak of information from his financial disclosure Wednesday\u2014though it later emerged that the form was available to the public. \"In light of the leak of my financial disclosure info which is a felony. I will be contacting @FBI and @TheJusticeDept #swamp @Reince45,\" Scaramucci said in a now-deleted tweet, per the Daily Beast. Scaramucci later denied suggestions that his tagging of Reince Priebus was a declaration of war on the White House chief of staff. \"Wrong! Tweet was public notice to leakers that all Sr Adm officials are helping to end illegal leaks,\" Scaramucci said in a second tweet. The disclosure information believed to have enraged Scaramucci appeared in a Politico report late Wednesday. According to the report, Scaramucci earned $4.9 million from his ownership stake in the SkyBridge Capital plus more than $5 million in salary from Jan. 1, 2016, to the end of June this year, when he began a short-lived stint at the federal Export-Import Bank. The New York Times notes that Scaramucci filed the disclosure form June 23 and under federal law, it would have been available to the public 30 days later. \"They aren't in process yet,\" Scaramucci wrote to the Times after being asked why he thought the report had been leaked. He didn't respond after being told it would have been available July 23."

Confidential personal information is what some paradegoers found among confetti tossed during the world's most famous parade. That information included social security numbers and banking information for police employees, some of whom are undercover officers.Ethan Finkelstein, who was home from college on Thanksgiving break, was watching the parade at 65th Street and Central Park West, when he and a friend noticed a strip of confetti stuck onto her coat.\"It landed on her shoulder,\" Finkelstein told PIX11 News, \"and it says 'SSN' and it's written like a social security number, and we're like, 'That's really bizarre.'It made the Tufts University freshman concerned, so he and his friends picked up more of the confetti that had fallen around them.\"There are phone numbers, addresses, more social security numbers, license plate numbers and then we find all these incident reports from police.\"One confetti strip indicates that it's from an arrest record, and other strips offer more detail. \"This is really shocking,\" Finkelstein said. \"It says, 'At 4:30 A.M. a pipe bomb was thrown at a house in the Kings Grant' area.\"A closer look shows that the documents are from the Nassau County Police Department. The papers were shredded, but clearly not well enough.They even contain information about Mitt Romney 's motorcade, apparently from the final presidential debate, which took place at Hofstra University in Nassau County last month.Most significant, the confetti strips identified Nassau County detectives by name. Some of them are apparently undercover. Their social security numbers, dates of birth and other highly sensitive personal information was also printed on the confetti strips.\"I'm just completely in shock,\" said Finkelstein, 18. \"How could someone have this kind of information, and how could it be distributed at the Thanksgiving Day Parade?\"It's a question that PIX11 wanted an answer to as well. The Nassau County Police Department told PIX11, via a written statement from its commanding officer for public information, Inspector Kenneth Lack, \"The Nassau County Police Department is very concerned about this situation. We will be conducting an investigation into this matter as well as reviewing our procedures for the disposing of sensitive documents.\"For its part, the sponsor of the parade, Macy's, told PIX11 News that it uses \"commercially manufactured, multicolor confetti, not shredded paper.\"It appears that the confetti strips are shredded police documents. Where they came from is still a mystery, but the people looking into the issue are trained at solving mysteries , and since they have a personal stake in the investigation, it may be more likely to be conclusive. ||||| Federal prosecutors told a judge last week that they have started reassembling documents shredded by the Stanford Financial Group, whose owner, R. Allen Stanford, is charged with running a $7 billion Ponzi scheme. How do you reconstruct documents after they've been passed through a shredder? \n \n With a computer. In a typical reconstruction process, technicians feed all the available shreds into a scanner. An automated software program then assigns a unique ID to each piece and analyzes a number of characteristics, including size, color, indentation, and font. Using a matching algorithm, the software then identifies potential neighboring shreds, displaying them onscreen for an operator to confirm. (For the home user, an Israeli company sells software that can turn any PC and scanner into an \"unshredder.\") \n \n Advertisement \n \n \n \n Not all shredded documents can be put back together. The possibility and ease of reconstruction depends on the size of the shreds\u2014the smaller and more numerous the pieces, the harder it is to reconstruct a document. Strip shredders cut paper into long strips 1/8- to 5/16-inch wide and are the most popular option because of their speed and low cost\u2014but they're also the easiest to reassemble since they produce a relatively small number of large fragments. Cross-cut shredders, which slice paper into many tiny, confettilike pieces, are significantly more secure (and expensive), while shredders that pulverize paper into dust cost thousands of dollars but are essentially reconstruction-proof. (To secure top-secret information, the Department of Defense requires that the majority of shredded particles \"not exceed 5 square millimeters.\") When using a strip-shredder, the slicing direction also has implications for reconstruction. Horizontal cuts may leave entire lines of text intact. Vertical shredding, which ensures that sentences are broken up, is more secure. \n \n Before advances in scanning and computer technology, documents had to be reconstructed by hand. Assuming all the pieces are in one place, reassembling a shredded document is a bit like solving a jigsaw puzzle; the reconstructionist must painstakingly sift through the shreds, looking for matches. During the 1979 Iranian Revolution, students and militants who took over the U.S. Embassy in Tehran turned to local carpet weavers to reassemble classified CIA documents they found that had been shredded. These pages were later published in a set of about 60 volumes called Documents From the U.S. Espionage Den. And in 2002, former FBI agent William Daly took about an hour to reassemble a shredded page from the dictionary on Good Morning America. \n \n Got a question about today's news? Ask the Explainer.",

        "Document": "Steve Jobs' resignation as Apple Inc.'s CEO might seem like a step out of the spotlight at the world's largest company. But it is possible that little may change with the executive shuffle at Apple. \n \n As CEO, Jobs' bosses -- who he had to answer to -- were technically Apple's board of directors and shareholders. Jobs was also a member of the Apple board, but recently Apple had not listed anyone as Apple's official chairman. Instead, Apple listed two co-lead directors of the board; Andrea Jung, chairwoman and CEO of Avon Products Inc., and Arthur D. Levinson, chairman and CEO of Genentech Inc. Now Jobs is the chairman of the board. \n \n Photos: Steve Jobs and Apple's influence \n \n Jobs hasn't been running Apple's day to day operations since January, when he handed over those responsibilities to Tim Cook, the company's former chief operating officer who has been voted in as CEO by Apple's board. \n \n Despite being on a leave of absence for medical reasons, the details of which have remained private, Jobs has remained involved in some of Apple's biggest decisions this year. For example, it was Jobs who unveiled the iPad 2 in March, not Cook. \n \n As for who will announce and show off the iPhone 5 or iPad 3, Cook or Jobs, that remains to be seen. \n \n In being promoted from COO to CEO, Tim Cook has also been given a seat on Apple's board, just as Jobs had. \n \n The addition of Tim Cook to the board ups the number of directors from seven to eight.

Credit: Apple Inc. ||||| The only thing surprising about Steve Jobs's resignation\u2014which Apple had telegraphed several times already\u2014was the timing. Why now? Because of health concerns, maybe. Or maybe because now, right now, is the perfect time for the company to transition. \n \n When I say now, I'm not talking about the dusky timing of the press release; the cardinal rule of bad news is that you bury it as late as you can. I mean now in the broader context of Apple's future. And if the company's going to not just survive but thrive without Jobs, he couldn't have left any sooner. And he definitely couldn't have waited. \n \n Apple has literally never been stronger. A month ago they reported record quarterly earnings in a period with no significant product releases, no back to school or holiday boost, all amid what turned out to be a grotesquely challenging three months for competitors like Dell and HP. They were, for a brief period, the most valuable company in the world. Incredible. \n \n And a month from now? They'll be releasing their next iPhone on America's three major carriers. And very possibly something altogether new: an affordable iPhone, a handset for the masses. If that device does emerge, Apple will have transitioned from yuppie luxury to unprecedented populist value. \n \n So that's where Apple sits now, cratered between two mountainous achievements. If they'd waited any longer, the iPhone 5 announcement would've been fully shrouded in memories of Jobs; with a month's distance, new CEO Tim Cook has a chance to stand on his own. He can bask in the reflected glory of the iPhone instead of languishing in Jobs's shadow. The company will feel like it's in good hands. Because it is. \n \n What's easy to forget is that companies have long, long product cycles. The iPhone 5's been done for months; ditto, likely, iPad 3. And iPhone 6 plans are well underway. They'll all have a touch of Jobs in them. Even products with a longer horizon, future generations of MacBooks with sick-skinny bodies and flash storage and no optical disc, AppleTVs teeming with apps, will have Jobs's imprimatur. Especially since, uh, guys? He's staying on as Chairman of the Board. He's involved. \n \n So yes, there is a chance that Steve Jobs is resigning now because his medical situation has become so severe that he has no other choice. But we certainly hope not. And sincerely don't think so. Because this feels calculated, in the best possible way, to happen at the best possible time. Now. \n \n You can keep up with Brian Barrett, the author of this post, on Twitter, Facebook, or Google+. ||||| ANALYSIS \n \n He may still be chairman of the board, but in the eyes of the world Steve Jobs has ceased to be the heart of Apple. \n \n The succession plan, one of the most closely guarded secrets this side of D-Day, is running. As it has been running for at least two years; the date of Jobs's departure may not have been known, but that it was approaching most certainly was. \n \n These past couple of years have been the strongest test yet of Jobs's famous reality distortion field, his ability to convince everyone he works with that what he says is either true or can \u2014 must \u2014 be made so. But some realities are not to be denied. \n \n Apple without Jobs is now one of them. Like any empire without its Caesar, what the next Apple will be, what it does and how it does it, depends on which of the factions within gains control. \n \n Many Apples \n \n For there are many Apples. One is that of new chief executive Tim Cook, who is as much responsible for Apple's success as Jobs was. He turned the business of actually making the goods into an imperial machine, controlling suppliers and manufacturers with unmatched ruthlessness. Making close to 100-percent margins on consumer electronics in an austere, hyper-competitive market is as miraculous as anything ever demonstrated in a keynote. \n \n Then there's the Apple normal people know and write about, a company capable of producing an endless stream of new products with pitch-perfect cadence. It is a marketing powerhouse \u2014 for how else do you account for Apple's coronation as king of all things technology, when all it makes is a mobile phone now on its fourth incarnation, a mutant mobile phone too big to put in a pocket, and a few laptops? Put that way \u2014 a valid analysis that seems heretical \u2014 Apple's success is even more miraculous, more reality defying, than if it had been more like Sony with its huge range of products. \n \n And there's the innovatory Apple, which lives well beneath the radar. With the exception of the ghostly presence of Jonathan Ive, this is an invisible and unknown force. The products and services appear, companies are swallowed up, and the star players leave. The big decisions are no longer what chip to use, what new hardware features are too cool not to have, but what deals can be done with media companies, what marketing advantage can be gained by rounding up which supplier. \n \n Success through control \n \n The signs are strong that Tim Cook's Viking armies will prevail, and without a struggle. It's where the money comes from, and where any attack is to be resisted by any means necessary. Apple of late has become self-righteously litigious, a terrible temptation for any company with fewer ideas and far more money than once it had, but nearly irresistible for one that's learned that success comes through control. If you can't out-think the competition, then it can be controlled through lawsuits \u2014 and if you lose a few, it doesn't matter. The damage has been done. And Apple of late has been run by Cook. \n \n Apple of late has become self-righteously litigious, a terrible temptation for any company with fewer ideas and far more money than once it had. \n \n Looking beyond the iPhone and the iPad, both of which can only be refreshed so far, there is only uncertainty. Apple in the cloud is Apple unproven. Apple as innovator without Jobs is Apple unknown. Apple in a market where everyone else can do what it does, but can do it cheaper, is unApple. \n \n Apple will play to what strengths it has, and that looks like a marketing-led, litigiously-active, cash-rich giant determined to protect what it has over building out what comes next. \n \n For with Jobs, there was always a 'next', even if we didn't know what it was going to be. As one part of the company's history was maturing, Steve Jobs would always be there on stage, unveiling just one more thing: the Mac, the iMac, the iPod, the iPhone, the iPad. \n \n That won't happen again. Apple's future depends on the new next, and the longer we have to wait to see what happens, the less likely it will happen at all. ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Learn more ||||| It\u2019s been one year to the day since Robert Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump.\" \n \n Mueller\u2019s appointment came in the wake of Trump\u2019s decision to fire FBI Director James Comey, who was then heading the investigation. Allegations had also surfaced that Trump had asked Comey to scale back the probe into former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn. Mueller was granted the authority to prosecute any federal crimes he uncovered. \n \n Mueller served in the Vietnam War as a Marine, receiving a Purple Heart. Following a career in both the public and private sectors, including several years as a federal prosecutor, Mueller served as FBI director from 2001 to 2013. He gave up his position with the law firm WilmerHale to take the special counsel appointment. \n \n In its first year, the Mueller investigation has remained tight-lipped about its activities, except when it comes to indictments and plea deals. The investigation has obtained five guilty pleas, plus indictments numbering in the double digits. The team has done this while coming under attack by Trump and his allies, who allege partisan bias and decry it as a \"disgusting, illegal and unwarranted witch hunt.\" \n \n Meanwhile, the investigation\u2019s endgame could involve complicated legal decisions about whether presidents can be subpoenaed or indicted, and whether Trump can fire Mueller or use pardons to stymie the probe. \n \n Who\u2019s on Mueller\u2019s team? \n \n The Special Counsel\u2019s office had made public the identities of 17 attorney staff members, spurring Trump to criticize the investigators are largely \"hardened Democrats.\" \n \n Through public records, we were able to independently confirm that at least 12 people on Mueller\u2019s staff are registered Democrats. Two others are registered to vote but have not chosen a party affiliation. We were unable to independently confirm the status of two other staff members. \n \n Mueller, though, is registered as a Republican in the District of Columbia and was appointed to offices by Republican presidents Ronald Reagan, George H.W. Bush and George W. Bush, as well as by Democrats Bill Clinton and Barack Obama. \n \n In addition, Mueller was appointed by Rosenstein, who was nominated for deputy attorney general by Trump himself, and who previously was appointed as a U.S. Attorney by George W. Bush (and later kept on by Obama). \n \n It\u2019s worth noting that other FBI or Justice Department personnel are assisting the investigation in certain capacities, but the names of investigative and office support personnel have not been made public. \n \n Mueller was prevented from considering political affiliation when putting together his team by both Justice Department policy and the Civil Service Reform Act. Moreover, the career attorneys on the Mueller team are bound by professional codes to pursue justice and rise above partisanship. \n \n What has the investigation produced so far? \n \n Within a month of his appointment, Mueller began looking into the question of whether Trump obstructed justice. \n \n On Oct. 30, 2017, Paul Manafort and his business partner Rick Gates \u2014 two former senior officials with the Trump campaign \u2014 were indicted on 12 counts related to their political consulting business, including money laundering. Also on that day, George Papadopoulos, a former Trump campaign aide, pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI. \n \n On Dec. 1, 2017, Flynn pled guilty to making false statements to the FBI about conversations he\u2019d had with then-Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak. \n \n On Feb. 16, 2018, Mueller indicted 13 Russian nationals and three Russian entities on charges related to the 2016 election. \n \n Days later, Dutch lawyer Alex van der Zwaan pled guilty for lying to the FBI about his dealings with Gates and another unnamed person. He was later sentenced to 30 days in prison. \n \n On Feb. 22, Mueller upped the ante against Manafort and Gates with 32 new financial charges. Within days, Gates pled guilty to conspiracy and lying to the FBI. Manafort, however, has continued to fight his charges. \n \n Beyond these official acts, the Mueller investigation has publicly announced little about what it is doing, and leaks from its own ranks have been scarce to nonexistent. So its activities remain largely hidden. \n \n Can Mueller subpoena Trump? \n \n Most legal experts told PolitiFact that being president doesn\u2019t offer blanket protection against a subpoena, as Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani has claimed. But there are enough gaps in the legal precedent that Trump\u2019s team could raise legal challenges that the courts would have to take seriously. \n \n In a case involving President Bill Clinton, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that a civil suit could go forward against a sitting president, rather than having to wait until their term was over. Given that the court green-lighted a presidential interview in a civil suit such as this one, it might be even more likely to do so in a criminal investigation, experts said. But the reality is that no one knows how the high court would rule in a criminal case related to Mueller\u2019s investigation. \n \n Meanwhile, in the Watergate-related case United States vs. Nixon, special prosecutor Leon Jaworski wanted tapes of President Richard Nixon talking to his aides. Nixon, citing executive privilege, refused to hand them over. But the high court unanimously sided with the prosecution. \n \n This decision suggests that presidents are not exempt from subpoenas in a criminal investigation. That said, it may depend on the nature of the subpoena. The court today could decide that a subpoena for in-person questioning -- rather than documents or tapes -- could be overly broad, or that some potential subpoena requests fall too far outside the scope of Mueller\u2019s investigation. \n \n Can Mueller indict Trump? \n \n Officially, there has never been a binding judicial opinion on this question. \n \n \"It is unresolved,\" said Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the law school at the University of California-Irvine. \"The Watergate grand jury in 1974 named Richard Nixon an \u2018unindicted co-conspirator\u2019 because they did not know if they could indict a sitting president.\" \n \n That said, there is a widespread assumption among legal experts that courts would rule against the idea of prosecuting a sitting president. \n \n This is primarily due to a pair of opinions by the Office of Legal Counsel, the closely watched office within the Justice Department that advises presidential administrations on the legality of taking certain positions or actions. \n \n The office looked at this question in 1973 and 2000, concluded on both occasions that a president could not be criminally prosecuted. Criminal prosecution, the office determined, would undermine the executive branch\u2019s ability to perform its functions. Ultimately, \"only the House of Representatives has the authority to bring charges of criminal misconduct through the constitutionally sanctioned process of impeachment,\" the office wrote in 2000. \n \n Can Trump fire Mueller? \n \n Over the course of the year, Trump has mulled, privately and publicly, whether he should remove Mueller. \n \n Mueller\u2019s potential removal falls into a legal gray area that involves Justice Department regulations, congressional statutes and constitutional law. \n \n Under Justice Department regulations, only the attorney general can fire Mueller. In this instance, Rosenstein, who\u2019s acting as attorney general in place of Attorney General Jeff Sessions for this purpose, would have that authority. (Sessions recused himself from the investigation.) \n \n The regulations also state that in order to fire Mueller, there has to be a good reason \u2014 specifically \"misconduct, dereliction of duty, incapacity, conflict of interest, or for other good cause, including violation of departmental policies.\" \n \n Under this scenario, Trump could order Rosenstein to fire Mueller, but Rosenstein could refuse if he believed that there had been no misconduct by Mueller. \n \n Alternately, the president could fire Rosenstein, and then continue firing Justice Department brass until someone was willing to fire Mueller. But the official who ultimately carried it out could face enormous public blowback. \n \n A third possibility is that Trump could seek to rescind the Justice Department regulations. However, this would require a lengthy process that would allow Mueller to continue operating in the meantime. \n \n What if a court decided that Mueller\u2019s appointment \u2014 and firing \u2014 was governed by congressional statute rather than the Justice Department rules? That would allow Trump to fire Mueller directly, since the congressional statute contains no requirement for misconduct before a firing. \n \n However a firing was carried out, Mueller would have standing to challenge it in court. \n \n A more promising course for Trump than firing Mueller might be convincing Sessions to narrow the scope of his recusal. If Sessions agreed to do that, he could curb the scope of Muller\u2019s probe. \n \n Could Trump use pardons to get around Mueller? \n \n As early as July 2017, news reports suggested that the White House and its legal advisers were weighing whether and how to use the president\u2019s power. \n \n Can the president pardon himself? Even legal experts who are skeptical acknowledge that no one knows for sure. \n \n The Constitution doesn\u2019t explicitly prohibit a self-pardon, except in the case of impeachment. However, experts said there are several more circumstantial arguments that, collectively, make a strong case that a self-pardon would be impermissible. \n \n The Constitution uses the word \"grant,\" which ordinarily means giving to someone else, said Harold H. Bruff, an emeritus University of Colorado law professor. Going back to its English monarchical origins, a pardon has long been conceived as an act of mercy. Neither of these suggest something that can be done to oneself. \n \n In addition, Bruff said that when the Constitution was being written, \"a background value everywhere in the air was that no one should be a judge in their own cause.\" This notion, sometimes referred to in Latin as \"nemo judex in causa sua,\" is a longstanding common-law principle, he said. \n \n It\u2019s worth noting a downside of a president pardoning themself: It\u2019s a tacit acknowledgement that they had committed a crime, which could supercharge impeachment efforts. \n \n Pardoning presidential associates could be more effective, but that would not be a cure-all for Trump, either. \n \n \"A pardon would not end an investigation into any one person as the investigation is about the Russian interference with the election,\" Robenalt said. \"The fact that someone may be pardoned or dead matters not to an investigator who is trying to connect dots.\" \n \n To truly shut down the probe using pardon power, a president would either have to separately pardon a multitude of individuals by name \u2014 a rolling game of \"Whac-a-Mole,\" as Bruff put it \u2014 or else issue a blanket amnesty. While such blanket amnesties have been implemented before, none have been enacted to protect a presidency. \n \n CORRECTION, May 17, 2018, 12:00 noon: This version corrects the number of guilty pleas obtained by Mueller. It is five, not four.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Thursday is the one-year anniversary of the start of Robert Mueller's investigation, and President Trump is among those marking the occasion. His tweet, however, drips with sarcasm. \"Congratulations America, we are now into the second year of the greatest Witch Hunt in American History ... and there is still No Collusion and No Obstruction,\" he writes. \"The only Collusion was that done by Democrats who were unable to win an Election despite the spending of far more money!\" In another tweet, he calls the investigation \"disgusting, illegal and unwarranted\" and said his administration has nonetheless had \"the most successful\" first 17 months of any White House, \"by far!\" Related coverage: The basics: Mueller was appointed special counsel to investigate \"any links and/or coordination between the Russian government and individuals associated with the campaign of President Donald Trump,\" explains PolitiFact. Mueller quickly expanded his investigation into whether Trump obstructed justice, notably by firing FBI chief James Comey. The piece hits other nuts and bolts of the investigation."

        "Summary": "The FLNC, a militant group in Corsica, has decided to abandon its armed struggle for independence from France, which began in 1976. The group has engaged in terrorism, including bombings and assaults, but now plans to demilitarize and pursue political channels. Corsica, located in the Mediterranean, has been under French control since the 1700s. Ajaccio, the capital and birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte, saw increased violence after a 1998 assassination. A 1997 bombing spree and a 2003 ceasefire preceded this shift. A recent property bill also influenced the decision. The island has 320,000 residents, with 40% of properties being second homes.",
        "Document": "Story highlights Militant group will accept its identity as a French territory, the group says \n \n The separatist group has sought independence since 1976 \n \n After nearly 40 years, a militant group on the island of Corsica says it is abandoning its armed struggle for independence from France. \n \n The banned National Liberation Front of Corsica, also known an FLNC, said Wednesday in a statement obtained by CNN affiliate France 3 that it had made the decision with no preconditions and had started the process of demilitarization. \n \n The birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte, Corsica is located in the Tyrrehenian Sea, part of the Mediterranean, between the coasts of France and Italy. It has been under French control since the 1700s. \n \n The island has been plagued by terrorism -- including bombings, robberies, and assaults -- since 1976, with the FLNC in the throes of a long, low-intensity military campaign against French targets on the island. \n \n In 1997, several banks and government offices were targeted in more than 50 bomb explosions in one day, for which FLNC claimed responsibility. \n \n France's government launched a ferocious crackdown in Corsica after a top French official there was gunned down in 1998 on the street of Ajaccio. This spurred a series of nationalist protests, followed by a string of FLNC attacks against French targets. \n \n A branch of the separatist group announced in 2003 that it would suspend its military actions. But attacks by FLNC continued, although with less frequency. ||||| Corsica\u2019s largest armed independence group has said it will lay down its weapons in favour of conventional political channels to further its ambitions on the French Mediterranean island. \n \n The unexpected decision by the National Liberation Front of Corsica signals an end to almost 40 years of armed struggle for Corsican independence that began with a series of attacks in May 1976. \n \n It also comes just a few months after Eta, the militant Basque separatist organisation, revealed in February that it had agreed to decommission some of its cache of weapons and explosives, taking a further step towards drawing a line under decades of bloody conflict in Spain. \n \n In a communiqu\u00e9 issued on Wednesday evening, the FLNC said: \u201cWithout prior notification and without ambiguity, our organisation has unilaterally decided to start a demilitarisation process and a progressive exit from clandestine activities.\u201d \n \n It added: \u201cThe time has come for our organisation to intensify the fight in the public arena.\u201d \n \n Gilles Millet, a journalist at Corsica, a monthly publication that has had contact with the armed group in the past, said that the 14-page communiqu\u00e9 was authentic. \n \n The group, which Mr Millet said comprised more than 100 members and whose independence cause still enjoys support among many of the island\u2019s 320,000 residents, said that part of the reason for disarmament was several recent advances via conventional means. \n \n In April, the local assembly approved a bill limiting land and property purchases to those who have been a Corsican resident for at least five years. The idea was to put an end to a wave of speculation-driven inflation in real estate prices on the island in recent years. \n \n An estimated 40 per cent of properties on the island are second homes owned by non-residents. Now a popular tourist destination, Corsica was conquered by the French in the 18th century. Ajaccio, the capital, was the birthplace of Napoleon Bonaparte. \n \n The FLNC said on Wednesday that measures such as the property-owning restrictions \u201con subjects prohibited for so many years, trace the outlines of a political solution . . . we are moving from a phase of combat and resistance to a phase of the construction of a true Corsican political power\u201d. \n \n Thousands of attacks have been carried out in Corsica and the French mainland since the separatist movement was founded, with the FLNC claiming responsibility in many cases. \n \n The attacks have included the murder of policemen, the bombing of banks in Paris and rocket attacks on government buildings.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 There is now one less armed separatist group in Europe: After nearly 40 years and thousands of attacks, including bombings and assassinations, the National Liberation Front of Corsica has decided to call it a day, CNN reports. The banned militant group, which launched its violent campaign for independence from France in 1976, says it has begun the process of demilitarization without preconditions and will pursue its goals through political channels. The group's cause still has plenty of support on the island of 320,000 people, where at least 40% of homes are second properties owned by non-residents, the Financial Times finds. The regional assembly recently restricted property purchases to those who have been residents for at least five years, and the militants say that move and similar ones show that \"we are moving from a phase of combat and resistance to a phase of the construction of a true Corsican political power.\""

It highlights the digital world's impact, with students favoring iPhones and BlackBerries. The list stresses the importance of scholarship patience, as students used to instant access must learn to research information in books and journals.

Flowing in every day, these data are added to the Wayback Machine after an embargo period. \n \n Beloit, Wis. \u2013 Born when Ross Perot was warning about a giant sucking sound and Bill Clinton was apologizing for pain in his marriage, members of this fall\u2019s entering college class of 2014 have emerged as a post-email generation for whom the digital world is routine and technology is just too slow. \n \n Each August since 1998, Beloit College has released the Beloit College Mindset List. It provides a look at the cultural touchstones that shape the lives of students entering college this fall. The creation of Beloit\u2019s Keefer Professor of the Humanities Tom McBride and former Public Affairs Director Ron Nief, it was originally created as a reminder to faculty to be aware of dated references, and quickly became a catalog of the rapidly changing worldview of each new generation. The Mindset List website at www.beloit.edu/mindset, the Mediasite webcast and its Facebook page receive more than 400,000 hits annually. \n \n The class of 2014 has never found Korean-made cars unusual on the Interstate and five hundred cable channels, of which they will watch a handful, have always been the norm. Since \"digital\" has always been in the cultural DNA, they've never written in cursive and with cell phones to tell them the time, there is no need for a wrist watch. Dirty Harry (who\u2019s that?) is to them a great Hollywood director. The America they have inherited is one of soaring American trade and budget deficits; Russia has presumably never aimed nukes at the United States and China has always posed an economic threat. \n \n Nonetheless, they plan to enjoy college. The males among them are likely to be a minority. They will be armed with iPhones and BlackBerries, on which making a phone call will be only one of many, many functions they will perform. They will now be awash with a computerized technology that will not distinguish information and knowledge. So it will be up to their professors to help them. A generation accustomed to instant access will need to acquire the patience of scholarship. They will discover how to research information in books and journals and not just on-line. Their professors, who might be tempted to think that they are hip enough and therefore ready and relevant to teach the new generation, might remember that Kurt Cobain is now on the classic oldies station. The college class of 2014 reminds us, once again, that a generation comes and goes in the blink of our eyes, which are, like the rest of us, getting older and older. \n \n Most students entering college for the first time this fall\u2014the Class of 2014\u2014were born in 1992. \n \n For these students, Benny Hill, Sam Kinison, Sam Walton, Bert Parks and Tony Perkins have always been dead. \n \n 1.

Six people were arrested. \n \n A state department official told the BBC: \"The president and secretary of state have both said the video at the core of this is offensive, disgusting, and reprehensible - but that is no justification for violence, and it is important for responsible leaders to stand up and speak out against violence. \n \n \"Therefore we find Mr Bilour's announcement is inflammatory and inappropriate. We note that the prime minister's office has dissociated itself from his comments.\" \n \n In hiding \n \n The exact origins of Innocence of Muslims, the low-budget film that has prompted the unrest, are unclear. \n \n The alleged producer of the trailer of the film, Nakoula Basseley Nakoula, is in hiding. \n \n Anti-US sentiment grew after a trailer for the film dubbed into Arabic was released on YouTube earlier this month. \n \n US citizens have been urged not to travel to Pakistan, and the US embassy has paid for adverts on Pakistani TV showing President Barack Obama and Secretary of State Hillary Clinton condemning the film. \n \n Although US targets have borne the brunt of protests against the film, anti-Western sentiment has been stoked further by caricatures of the Prophet Muhammad published this week in the satirical French magazine, Charlie Hebdo. \n \n France shut embassies and other missions in about 20 countries across the Muslim world on Friday. \n \n An 18-year-old man who threatened the magazine's editors on Facebook has been charged with terrorism-related activity following his arrest in the southern French city of Toulon, a judicial source told AFP news agency on Sunday.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 A US official has called it \"inflammatory and inappropriate\" for a Pakistani minister to offer a $100,000 bounty for killing the filmmaker of Innocence of Muslims. Railways Minister Ghulam Ahmad Bilour, who made the offer, said he would pay the bounty out of his own pocket as protests continued yesterday against the anti-Islamic film. Bilour, who called himself a \"Muslim first and a government representative second,\" said he has invited the Taliban and al-Qaeda to carry out the assassination, reports CNN. Pakistani government officials have similarly blasted the offer. A US State Department official told the BBC yesterday: \"The president and secretary of state have both said the video at the core of this is offensive, disgusting, and reprehensible\u2014but that is no justification for violence, and it is important for responsible leaders to stand up and speak out against violence.\" In another threat, this one aimed at the French publication Charlie Hebdo for printing cartoons of the prophet Mohammed, an 18-year-old man who threatened the magazine's editors on Facebook has been charged with terrorism-related activity."

        "Summary": "Imperial College London researchers studied C57BL/6 male mice, focusing on acetate's impact on the hypothalamus. Published in Nature Communications, the study found that short-chain fatty acids like acetate from inulin reduce energy intake and obesity. PET scans showed acetate's path to the hypothalamus, affecting neurotransmitters. Gut bacteria ferment fiber, producing acetate, which signals the brain to suppress hunger. The study also explored appetite-suppressing hormones and metabolic processes, suggesting an acetate pill for obesity treatment.",
        "Document": "Animals and treatments \n \n Animal experiments were performed at Imperial College London except for high resolution magic angle spinning (HMRS) experiments which were performed at Instituto de Investigaciones Biom\u00e9dicas \u2018Alberto Sols\u2019 (IIB). Experiments conducted at Imperial College London were approved by Imperial College London, and all animal procedures were performed in accordance with the UK Animals Scientific Procedures Act (1986). IIB experiments were approved by the ethical committee of the Instituto de Investigaciones Biomedicas \u2018Alberto Sols\u2019 (and met the guidelines of the national (R.D. 53/2013) and the European Community (2010/62/UE) for care and management of experimental animals. Unless otherwise stated, all experiments were performed in C57BL/6 male mice (6\u20138 weeks old, Charles River, Margate, UK) that were single-housed under controlled temperature (21\u201323 oC) and light conditions (12 h light\u2013dark cycle; lights on at 07:00 hours). \n \n The effect of HF-I versus HF-C on body weight and energy intake \n \n Mice were randomized and assigned to two different groups (n=12): HFD with cellulose as a control (HF-C), HFD+oligofructose-enriched inulin (Synergy) (HF-I). Synergy is a fructan-based preparation containing both long- and short-chain fructo-oligosaccharides. Synergy was mixed with the HFD individually in the ratio of 1:9. The two diets were isocaloric, each contained the same total energy of 4.6 kcal g\u22121, with 41.8% energy from fat. The diets were made isocaloric by the addition of cellulose. Nutritional composition of the diet is shown in Table 1. The diets were fed ad libitum for 8 weeks to respective groups of animals. Body weights and food intake were measured three times per week. \n \n Table 1: Nutritional content of the HFD-C and HFD-I diets. Full table Figures/tables index \n \n Determination of acetate concentrations in serum and faeces \n \n SCFAs were determined by gas chromatography in the colonic contents and serum of mice that where freshly culled. The method used was adapted from Richardson et al.35 Briefly, caecal contents were weighed (20\u2013220 \u03bcg) and combined with 550 \u03bcl of PBS. Samples were vortex mixed for 1 min, centrifuged at 3,000 g for 10 min and the supernatant was collected. To 500 \u03bcl supernatant, 25 \u03bcl of internal standard and 2-ethylbutyric acid was added to give a final concentration of 5 mmol l\u22121. Acids were extracted by the addition of 250 \u03bcl concentrated hydrochloric acid and 1 ml diethyl ether followed by vortex mixing for 1 min. Samples were centrifuged for 10 min at 3,000 g and the ether layer was removed and transferred to a separate capped vial. N-methyl-N-t-butyldimethylsilyltrifluoroacetamide (MTBSTFA; Sigma) was added (100 \u03bcl) before heating at 80 \u00b0C for 20 min. \n \n Gas chromatography was performed on a Hewlett Packard 5890 Series II instrument equipped with a flame ionization detector, split/splitless injector and a 10-m, 0.18 mm ID and 0.20 \u03bcm df Rtx-1 (Crossbond 100% dimethyl polysiloxane, Thames Restek UK, Ltd) capillary column. Injector and detector temperatures were 275 oC with the column temperature programmed from 63 \u00b0C for 3 min to 190 oC at 10 \u00b0C per min. Helium served as the carrier gas (head pressure 135 kPa) and injections (1 \u03bcl) were made in the split mode (50:1 split). Peak areas were recorded and all subsequent data manipulation was completed using ChemStation Software (Agilent Technologies, USA). External standards for acetate, propionate, n-butyrate, iso-butyrate, n-valerate and caproate were prepared at concentrations of 25, 12.5, 6.25, 1.25 and 0.625 mM and ethyl butyric acid was used as the internal standard at a concentration of 100 mM. Reported values were normalized according to the weight of original sample used. \n \n Serum SCFA measurement \n \n A 100\u2013500-\u03bcl aliquot of serum was filtered through a 30-kDa micropartition system (Vivaspin RC VS02H22 filters, Sartorius Inc., Mississauga, ON, Canada) by centrifugation at 14,000 g at 4 \u00b0C for 90 min. An internal standard solution (25 \u03bcl) consisting of 100 mM ethylbutyrate and 100 mM formic acid was added to 225 \u03bcl of the protein-free filtrate supernatant in a 2-ml Hichrom vial (Agilent Technologies, South Queensferry, UK). To measure SCFA, 1 \u03bcl of each sample was injected into a 5,890 Series II GC system (HP, Crawley, UK) fitted with a NukolTM Capilllary Column (30 m \u00d7 0.53 mm \u00d7 1.0 \u03bcm, SUPELCOTM Analytical, UK) and flame ionization detector. The carrier gas, helium, was delivered at a flow rate of 14 ml min\u22121. The head pressure was set at 10 p.s.i. with split injection. Run conditions were: initial temperature 60 \u00b0C, 1 min; +20 \u00b0C min\u22121 to 145 \u00b0C; +4 \u00b0C min\u22121 to 200 \u00b0C, hold 25 min. Peaks were integrated using Agilent ChemStation software (Agilent Technologies, Oxford, UK) and SCFA content quantified by single-point internal standard method. Peak identity and internal response factors were determined using a 1-mM calibration cocktail including acetate, propionate and butyrate. \n \n PET-CT analysis of acetate biodistribution \n \n Mice were fasted overnight. Animals received 11C-acetate (~20 MBq) at the beginning of PET scan either through i.v. tail vein (n=3) or colonically by using tubing placed 1 cm into the rectum (n=4). At the time of the scan, animals were anaesthetized with a 2\u20132% isofluorane\u2013oxygen mix. After the animals were placed in the micro PET/CT scanner (PET/CT (Siemens), a CT scan without contrast was performed, followed by the PET scan and lastly followed by a CT scan where contrast Ultravist 370 (Bayer, AG, Germany) was infused. \n \n During the scan, animals were maintained at 1\u20131% isofluorane\u2013oxygen mix and body temperature of 37 \u00b0C. The CT had an X-ray source of 80 kVp and 500 \u03bcA with exposure time 200 ms and isotropic resolution of 103 \u03bcm. The scan consisted of three bed positions with a 20% overlap. The CT scan was used for anatomical data and attenuation correction purposes. The PET system consisted of 64 lutetium oxyothosilicate based detectors blocks arranged in four contiguous rings, with a crystal ring diameter of 16.1 cm and an axial extent of 12.7 cm. Each detector block was composed of a 20 \u00d7 20 array of lutetium oxyothosilicate crystals coupled to a position sensitive photomultiplier tube via a light guide. Each crystal was 10 mm long and had a cross-sectional area of 1.51 \u00d7 1.51 mm. The crystal pitch was 1.59 mm in both axial and transverse directions. Inveon Research Workplace version 3 (Siemens) was used for data analysis. Images with matrix size 12 \u00d7 128, pixel size 0.776 mm2 and slice thickness 0.796 mm were reconstructed from the two-dimensional sinogram by two-dimensional-filtered backprojection using a ramp filter with a nyquist frequency of 0.5. Dynamic framing was used in reconstruction with 20 \u00d7 3 s frames, 8 \u00d7 30 s frames, 5 \u00d7 60 s frames and 10 \u00d7 300 s frames. Attenuation correction was also used to correct the image. Reconstructed PET images were then registered onto the CT images. PET signals on the desired region of interest were obtained over the scan period (1 h). Percentage injected dose (% ID per g) was calculated by using the following Equations (1) and (2), where; \u03bb=0.693/T 1/2 , T 1/2 is the half-life of the radionuclide, I t is activity at a given time where I 0 is the starting activity and t is the time passed, C PET is the contrast of the image and ID is the activity of the injected acetate. \n \n Effect of i.p. acetate on energy intake \n \n Mice were fasted overnight before receiving either 500 mg kg\u22121 sodium acetate dissolved in 0.9% saline (n=22) or vehicle control (0.9% saline; n=21) pH 7.0, This dosage of acetate was similar to that used to suppress lipolysis in previous studies and was shown to be well tolerated14. Food intake was measured 1, 2, and 4 h post injection. \n \n Effect of i.c.v. acetate on energy intake \n \n Male Wistar rats 190\u2013240 g (specific pathogen free; Charles River) were placed in a stereotaxic frame (David Kopf Instruments) under 0.5-2.5% isoflurane anaesthesia. A hole was drilled using a stereotactically mounted electric drill using coordinates calculated from the Rat Brain Atlas as described previously36, according to the coordinates of Paxinos and Watson37 (0.8 mm posterior to the Bregma in the midline and 6.5 mm below the surface of the skull). A permanent 22-gauge stainless steel cannula (Plastics One Inc., Roanoke, Virginia, USA) projecting to the third cerebral ventricle was implanted. Dental cement was used to hold the cannula in position anchored by three stainless steel screws inserted into the skull. The skin was approximated using nylon sutures. After a 7 day recovery period, animals were handled daily and acclimatized to the injection procedure. To ensure that cannulae were correctly positioned, rats received i.c.v. 150 ng angiotensin II in a 5-\u03bcl volume via a 28-gauge stainless steel injector placed into and projecting 1 mm below the tip of the cannula. Rats were observed for a prompt drinking response. A total volume of 5 \u03bcl was injected over 1 min to conscious, freely moving rats. For feeding studies, rats (n=15) were fasted overnight and then injected between 09:00 and 10:00 hours with sodium acetate (2.5 \u03bcmol) or an equivalent osmotic sodium chloride control (5 \u03bcl) and returned to their home cage. Food intake was measured at 1, 2 and 4 h post injection. After a 72-h washout period, rats received either the acetate or sodium chloride in a cross-over manner and food intake measured as previously described. \n \n Effect of liposome encapsulate acetate on food intake \n \n Nanoparticle design was based upon our previous studies where PEGylated liposomes were formulated for labelling and visualization of cells38, or specifically designed for preferential uptake in xenograft tumours15. Liposomes were prepared by the thin-film hydration method39. Liposomes were prepared with either acetate (1 M, pH 2.3) to form liposome-encapsulated acetate (LITA) nanoparticles or HEPES for use as a control. Particle size was determined using a Malvern Zetasizer (Malvern Instruments, UK). Quantification of acetate encapsulated within LITA nanoparticles was determined using 1H nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. LITA formulation (200 \u03bcl) was scanned with addition of albumin that binds to acetate in free solution reducing the NMR signal for the compound40. A liposome-free control solution containing an equivalent concentration of acetate (4 mM) was also scanned with and without the addition of albumin (2 g). LITA solution was scanned following the addition of lactate (5.2 mg sodium lactate) to act as a quantitative control. Spectra were obtained using a Bruker DRX 11.74T NMR spectrometer. Spectra were analysed using MestRe-C NMR spectroscopy software (Santiago de Compostela, Spain). \n \n To assess short-term biodistribution, a liposome formulation containing an additional 0.1% of a rhodamine\u2013lipid complex (DOPE-Rhodamine: 1,2-dioleoyl-sn-glycero-3-phosphoethanolamine-N-(lissamine rhodamine B sulfonyl) was used to determine biodistibution through ex vivo histological analysis. Samples were collected 4 h post i.p. injection (n=4). No significant accumulation of liposome was observed in the brain of the treated mice despite being present in the liver and heart. \n \n The effect of acetate on behaviour \n \n Mice were fasted overnight before receiving either a single i.p. injection of saline, 500 mg kg\u22121 acetate or 2.5 M LiCl as a positive control for aversive behaviour41 (n=8 per group). The behavioural patterns of each mouse were observed for 15 s every 5 min from the time of injection until 1 h post injection. Behaviours was classified using a modified version of a previously published protocol42. Briefly, behaviours was classified into 10 different categories: feeding, drinking, locomotion (including rearing and climbing), bed making, burrowing, grooming, still, sleeping, head down (animal in abnormal body posture: back hunched, eyes shut or half-shut and pilo erect\u2014indicative of impaired health status) and tremors. \n \n Acetate tolerance test \n \n Glucose levels were determined from blood taken from mouse tails using a Glucometer Elite glucometer (Bayer Corp.). Experiments were performed on ad libitum fed mice at 14:00 h as previously described for insulin tolerance tests18 but instead of insulin, animals were injected i.p. with either 500 mg kg\u22121 sodium acetate or saline control (n=9\u201310). Blood glucose values were then determined at the times indicated. Results were expressed as fold change of initial blood glucose concentration before injections. \n \n Plasma PYY and GLP-1 hormone analysis \n \n All samples were assayed in duplicate and in a single assay to eliminate inter assay variation. Plasma PYY and GLP-1 were assessed using an established in-house radioimmunoassay as described previously43, 44. \n \n Hypothalamic quantitative PCR \n \n This was carried out using the methods described by Bewick et al.45 Quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-qPCR) was used to study the expression of the different target genes. Total RNA was extracted from the whole hypothalami using TRIZOL (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer\u2019s protocol. All samples were treated by DNaseI (Invitrogen) before the reverse transcription. First-strand cDNAs were prepared using 1 \u03bcg RNA and SuperScriptII Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen) in the presence of random hexamer and oligo(dT) primers (Promega, Charbonni\u00e8res-les-Bains, France). The qPCRs were performed using the Light Cycler Fast Start DNA Master SyBR Green I kit (Roche, Meylan, France) in the presence of specific primer pairs that were selected to amplify small fragments (100\u2013200 bp). PCR products were checked for specificity by measuring their melting temperature. Samples (in duplicate) were quantified by comparison with a standard curve obtained by dilutions of purified-specific cDNAs. \n \n Measurements of AGRP and POMC mRNA expression \n \n RNA was extracted from dissected hypothalamus using Absolutely RNA microprep kit from Stratagene (La Jolla, CA, USA). The gene transcription for AgRP and POMC in the ARC of the hypothalamus was determined using real-time RT-PCR, and results were expressed as a ratio to the expression of the constitutive gene cyclophilin. The sequences of TaqMan probes and primers for cyclophilin (GenBank accession no. M15933) were: forward primer 5\u2032-CCCACCGTGTTCTTCGACAT; reverse primer 5\u2032-TGCAAACAGCTCGAAGCAGA-3\u2032; and probe 5\u2032-CAAGGGCTCGCCATCAGCCG-3\u2032. For AGRP, they were: forward primer 5\u2032-TTGGCAGAGGTGCTAGATCCA-3\u2032; reverse primer 5\u2032-AGGACTCGTGCAGCCTTACAC-3\u2032; and probe 5\u2032-CGAGTCTCGTTCTCCGCGTCGC-3\u2032. The probe and primers for POMC (assay identification no. Rn00595020_ml) were purchased from Applied Biosystems. \n \n Manganese-enhanced MRI \n \n MEMRI was performed using a 9.4-Tesla Varian INOVA imaging system (Varian Inc., USA) as described previously46. A fast spin-echo multi-slice sequence was applied with the following parameters: TR= 600 ms, TE=10 ms, matrix size= 256 \u00d7 192, FOV=25 \u00d7 25 mm and average=1 acquiring 46 \u00d7 0.4 mm thick slices. An array of 66 acquisitions was set up so that the 46 slices were acquired 66 times throughout the infusion. Normalized percentage enhancement in signal intensity was calculated for the ARC, VMH, PVN, periventricular nucleus (PE) and the nucleus of tractus solitarius27, 43. \n \n Hypothalamic measurement of AMP kinase \n \n Animals were killed by decapitation, brains were immediately dissected and the hypothalamus was removed and snap-frozen in liquid nitrogen. Frozen tissues (~100 mg) were homogenized in 0.4 ml of ice-cold 50 mm HEPES, pH 7.4, 50 mm sodium fluoride, 5 mm sodium pyrophosphate, 250 mm sucrose, 1 mm EDTA, 1 mm dithiothreitol, 1 mm benzamidine, 1 mm trypsin inhibitor, 0.1% (w/v) phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride using an UltraTurax homogenizer (3 \u00d7 30-s bursts). Insoluble material was removed by centrifugation and the resulting supernatant was used for immunoprecipitation of AMPK and western blot analysis. \n \n Immunoblotting and antibodies \n \n Samples were boiled in electrophoresis sample buffer and resolved on polyacrylamide gels. Proteins were transferred into PVDF membrane (Immobilon-FL, Millipore) and blocked with PBS containing 5% skimmed milk powder for 1 h. Antibodies were diluted in 5 ml high salt Tween buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.4, 500 mM NaCl and 0.5% Tween (v/v)), and incubated with the membrane. Primary antibodies used for immunoblotting are as follows: anti-AMPK-\u03b21/2 (in-house) (dilutions 1:3,000\u20131:10,000 for blotting), anti-phospho-ACC (S79) (Cell Signalling, cat. no. 3661), anti-phospho-AMPK (PT172) (Cell Signalling, cat. no. 2535) anti-\u03b2-actin (Sigma, cat. no. A5316). \n \n Primary antibodies were detected using fluorescently linked secondary antibodies (Alexa Fluor, Invitrogen, goat anti rabbit: A21109 and goat anti mouse: A21058). These were visualized using an Odyssey infrared imager (Li-Cor Biosciences). Quantification of results was performed using Odyssey software and expressed as a ratio of the signal obtained with the phospho-specific antibody relative to the appropriate total antibody. Full-length images of cut immunoblots are shown in Supplementary Fig. 1. \n \n The effect of acetate on hypothalamic metabolism \n \n [2-13C] acetate (500 mg kg\u22121) or [U-13C] inulin (100 mg) were administrated to 8\u201310-week-old C57BL/6J male mice (Charles River, Spain) after an overnight fasting (16 h) either with i.p. (n=18) or by gavage (n=4), respectively. All mice were anaesthetized with 4% isoflurane (3 l per min, 99% oxygen), and cerebral metabolism was arrested within 1.5 s using a high-power (5 kW) microwave fixation system (TMW-6402C, Muromachi Kikai Co. Ltd, Tokyo, Japan) immediately (0 min), 15 and 30 min after acetate, or 180 min after inulin, administrations. Fixed brains were dissected and hypothalamus and remaining brain biopsies were obtained and maintained frozen (\u221280 \u00b0C) until HR-MAS analyses. 13C (125,03 MHz) and 1H HR-MAS (500,13 MHz) spectra were acquired at 11.7 T (4 \u00b0C, 4,000 Hz rotation) with a Bruker AVANCE wide bore spectrometer equipped with a MAS accessory (Bruker Biospin, Rheinstetten, Germany). 1H-decoupled 13C HR-MAS spectra were acquired using a pulse-acquire sequence, with WALTZ-16 1H decoupling applied during the acquisition and relaxation delay periods. Conditions were \u03c0/4 pulses, 8,192 or 16,384 scans (for [2-13C] acetate or [U-13C] inulin measurements, respectively), 64 k data points, 5 s recycle delay. The 13C spectra were processed with Mestrelab ( http://mestrelab.com/). Chemical shifts of the 13C resonances were referred to the acetate C2 resonance (24.5 p.p.m.), and the 13C incorporation was normalized to the myo-inositol C1+C3 resonance (73.2 p.p.m.), which provides a useful internal reference from which all 13C resonances can be normalized independently of the amount of tissue20, 47, introducing appropriate corrections for nuclear Overhausser enhancement and saturation. \n \n 1H HR-MAS spectra from the same biopsies used for 13C HR-MAS acquisitions were acquired using the Carr-Purcell-Meiboom-Gil sequence. Acquisition parameters were 5 s water pre-saturation, echo time=144 ms, t=1 ms, n=100, 10 kHz spectral width, 32 k data points and 256 scans. Metabolite concentrations were evaluated using a modified version of the LCModel processing software (Linear Combination of Model Spectra, http://s-provencher.com/pages/schtm)48. \n \n Statistical tests were performed using two-tailed unpaired Student\u2019s t-test between values in the different time points or areas. Observations that fell below the Q1-1.5 \u00d7 IQR (interquartile range) or above the Q3+1.5 \u00d7 IQR range (with Q 1 and Q 3 representing the upper and lower quartiles values and IQR, the difference between Q 3 and Q 1 ) were considered outliers and were not taken into account for statistical evaluations. \n \n Data analysis \n \n Analyses were performed using Graph Pad Prism (GraphPad Software, San Diego, CA, USA) or Stata (StataCorp LP, College Station, TX, USA). All data was tested for normality using Shapiro\u2013Wilk test. Non-normally distributed data was log transformed to normalize the distribution. Comparison between groups was carried out by two-sided unpaired Student\u2019s t-test for two groups and one-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) with post hoc Tukey or Bonferroni correction if there were more than two groups. I.c.v. cross-over acetate injection studies were compared using a two-sided paired Student\u2019s t-test. Given the cumulative nature of both MEMRI and PET signal intensity data, differences in signal intensity profile between the regions of interest in all experimental groups were analysed using GEE and the Mann\u2013Whitney U-test with commercial statistical software (Stata, version 9.1; StataCorp), which compare profiles for the entirety scan.

An obvious candidate, they thought, might be one of the products of fibre fermentation in the gut. In particular they focused on the short-chain fatty acid acetate, because it is the most abundant and is known to circulate throughout the bloodstream. \n \n They fed mice fibre labelled with carbon-13, which has an additional neutron from the more common carbon-12 that gives its nuclei a magnetic spin and therefore makes it easy to track as it progresses through the body's chemical reactions. The fibre was fermented as usual into acetate, which turned up not only in the gut, but also in the hypothalamus, a part of the brain known to be involved in regulating appetite. There, the researchers found, it was metabolized through the glutamine-glutamate cycle, which is involved in controlling the release of neurotransmitters associated with appetite control. The same model has been proposed for acetate metabolism after drinking alcohol. \n \n The mice fed with large doses of fermentable fibre ate less food, and ended up weighing less than control mice that were fed unfermentable fibre. \n \n 'Simplistic' approach \n \n William Colmers, an electrophysiologist who studies the effect of neurotransmitters in the hypothalamus at the University of Alberta in Edmonton, Canada, says he thinks that the experimental work is solid, but worries that the results have been over-interpreted. \u201cMuch of it is extremely speculative,\u201d he says. For one thing, the dietary fibre levels were around 11%. At that level, \u201cthe room would be full of mouse farts\u201d, he says, so the animals may simply have been eating less because they were uncomfortable. \n \n Colmers adds that the hypothesis of how acetate in the hypothalamus was affecting the release of neurotransmitters to decrease appetite is \u201ca simplistic view of how the nervous system works\u201d. The release of neurotransmitters is \u201cexcruciatingly well regulated\u201d, he says, and not as sensitive to manipulation by changes in biochemistry as the authors suggest. \n \n Although the work was done in mice, Bell says that he sees \u201cno reason\u201d why the same mechanism shouldn\u2019t be at work in humans. \u201cAcetate is known to be metabolized in the human brain, and we have the right microbiota in our gut for the fermentation of fibre,\u201d he says. \n \n Bell and his colleagues are preparing to test their ideas in people. The question, however, is how much fibre do you have to eat? Most people's diet contains between 10 and 20 grams of fibre a day, and it can be difficult to increase this amount substantially. So Bell and his colleagues are working with companies that are looking into enriching fibre with acetate to boost the digestive system, and into ways of encasing acetate in nanoparticles so that it releases slowly throughout the day to help control appetite. \u201cIt\u2019s sort of a way of having your cake, and not eating it,\u201d says Bell. ||||| A pill that switches off hunger is on the horizon after scientists discovered an \u2018anti-appetite\u2019 molecule which tells the body to stop eating. \n \n Researchers at Imperial College discovered that people feel full when eating fruit and vegetables because fibre releases acetate into the gut. \n \n They believe that a pill derived from acetate could be created to help people cut down on food without experiencing any cravings. \n \n One in four adults in England is obese and that figure is set to climb to 60 per cent of men and 50 per cent of women by 2050. \n \n Obesity and diabetes already costs the UK over \u00a35billion every year which is likely to rise to \u00a350 billion in the next 36 years. \n \n Large amounts of acetate are released when plants and vegetables are digested by bacteria in the colon. The scientists tracked the molecule and found that it eventually ended up in the hypothalamus region of the brain, which controls hunger. \n \n The new study suggests obesity has become an epidemic because we have replaced the healthy diet of the past with processed food, which does not react with gut bacteria to produce acetate. So the brain does not receive a signal telling it to stop eating. \n \n The average diet in Europe today contains about 15 g of fibre per day. In Stone Age times it was around 100g per day. \n \n \"Unfortunately our digestive system has not yet evolved to deal with this modern diet and this mismatch contributes to the current obesity epidemic,\u201d said Professor Gary Frost, of Imperial College. \n \n Although scientists say their research should encourage more people to eat more fruit and vegetables, they also believe it could pave the way for new drugs to help dieters. \n \n Prof Frost added: \"Our research has shown the release of acetate is central to how fibre suppresses our appetite and this could help scientists tackle overeating. \n \n \"The major challenge is to develop an approach that will deliver the amount of acetate needed to suppress appetite but in a form that is acceptable and safe for humans. \n \n \"Developing these approaches will be difficult but it is a good challenge to have and we are looking forward to researching possible ways of using acetate to address health issues around weight gain.\u201d \n \n The study analysed the effects of a form of dietary fibre called inulin which comes from chicory and sugar beets and is also added to cereal bars. \n \n Experiments on mice found those fed on a high fat diet with added inulin ate less and gained less weight than animals given a lot of fat diet with no inulin. \n \n They also noticed that the acetate acculmulates in the hypothalamus of the brain where it triggers a series of chemical events which fire neurons and suppress hunger. \n \n The research also showed when acetate was injected into the bloodstream, the colon or the brain it reduced the amount of food eaten by the mice. \n \n Prof Jimmy Bell, of the Medical Research Council, Cambridge, who collaborated in the research, said: \"It is exciting we have started to really understand what lies behind fibre's natural ability to suppress our appetite and identified acetate as essential to the process. \n \n \"In the context of the growing rates of obesity in western countries, the findings of the research could inform potential methods to prevent weight gain.\" \n \n Acetate is only active for a short amount of time in the body so an \u2018acetate pill\u2019 would need to be able to mimic the chemical\u2019s slow release into the gut. \n \n Prof David Lomas, chair of the MRC's population and systems medicine board, said it is becoming increasingly clear the interaction between the gut and the brain plays a key role in controlling how much food we eat. \n \n He added: \"Being able to influence this relationship, for example using acetate to suppress appetite, may in future lead to new, non surgical treatments for obesity.\" ||||| TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health \n \n Scientists have figured out the reason fiber is such a wonder food: It contains an anti-appetite molecule called acetate. \n \n Acetate, the researchers discovered, is naturally released when fiber is digested in the gut, and when it\u2019s released, it is taken to the brain where it signals us to stop eating. \n \n Fiber has long been known to satiate appetite and keep us full for longer, but previous research supposed the reason was that it takes longer to digest, keeping us satisfied for longer after we\u2019ve stopped eating. But this new research published in the journal Nature Communications shows that the acetate released when we digest roughage lowers our appetites when it gets directly into our bloodstream, colon or brain. \n \n The researchers looked at a dietary fiber called inulin, which comes from chicory and sugar beets, and is often present in cereal bars. They fed mice a diet high in fat with additional inulin. These mice ate less and gained less weight than mice who did not consume inulin, and when the scientists took a deeper look, they discovered that the inulin-eating mice had higher levels of acetate in their gut. So, they used PET scans to track the inulin through the mice. \n \n They discovered that the acetate traveled from the colon to the liver and heart, and finally made it to the the area of the brain that deals with hunger, the hypothalamus region. Using more imaging, they determined that the acetate accumulates and spurs chemical reactions in the brain that send signals that suppress hunger. \n \n Eating more fiber, found in foods like nuts, oatmeal, beans, lentils, apples and blueberries, is one of the better ways to feel full and satisfied, and can help with weight management. Science says so.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Experts have long suggested that fiber keeps us feeling full because it takes a long time to digest, but new research challenges that notion\u2014and may point the way to a new anti-hunger pill. The key is a short-chain fatty acid called acetate, which emerges as fiber is digested. Acetate then makes its way to the brain's hypothalamus, where it builds up and triggers chemical reactions that tell us we're full, Time reports. Researchers reached this conclusion by scanning the progress of a dietary fiber called inulin through the bodies of mice. Those mice who ate fatty diets rich in inulin gained less weight than mice who didn't eat inulin. But one electrophysiologist not related to the study points out that the mice were fed dietary fiber levels of about 11%. He tells Nature that at such a level, \"the room would be full of mouse farts\"\u2014and perhaps the mice were eating less because they felt gassy. The researchers plan to next test the idea in humans. So could we eventually see an acetate-based diet pill? It's possible, the Telegraph suggests: \"The major challenge is to develop an approach that will deliver the amount of acetate needed to suppress appetite but in a form that is acceptable and safe for humans,\" a researcher says."

        "Document": "By Alex Acquisto , BDN Staff \u2022 June 14, 2017 2:30 pm \n \n Updated: June 22, 2017 1:24 pm \n \n HOPE, Maine \u2014 While jogging on a familiar, overgrown, wooded trail near her home on a recent warm afternoon, Rachel Borch thought to herself, \u201cwhat a beautiful day.\u201d \n \n Little did she know she was about to be attacked by a rabid raccoon she would end up killing with her bare hands. \n \n In the midst of appreciating the weather and scenery, she looked ahead and noticed a raccoon obstructing the narrow foot path, baring its tiny teeth. \n \n Suddenly, it began \u201cbounding\u201d toward her, Borch recalled Wednesday afternoon during an interview at her home on Hatchet Mountain Road in Hope. \n \n \u201cI knew instantly it had to be rabid,\u201d said Borch, who remembers ripping out her headphones and dropping her phone on the ground. \n \n What felt like a split second later, the furry animal was at her feet. Borch said she was \u201cdancing around it,\u201d trying to figure out what to do. \n \n \u201cImagine the Tasmanian devil,\u201d she said. \u201cIt was terrifying.\u201d \n \n The path was too narrow for Borch to run past the raccoon, which had begun lunging at her. With adrenaline pumping, Borch suspended her disbelief. \n \n \u201cI knew it was going to bite me,\u201d she said. \n \n Figuring she would have the greatest ability to defend herself if she used her hands to hold it down, she decided that probably would be the best place for the aggressive animal to latch on. \n \n The raccoon sank its teeth into Borch\u2019s thumb and \u201cwouldn\u2019t let go.\u201d Its paws were scratching her arms and legs wildly as Borch screamed and cried. \n \n In a matter of seconds, Borch, who could not unhinge the raccoon\u2019s jaw to shake it off her hand, noticed that when she had dropped her phone, it had fallen into a puddle in the path and was fully submerged. \n \n \u201cI didn\u2019t think I could strangle [the raccoon] with my bare hands,\u201d she remembers thinking, but holding it under the water might do the trick. \n \n Connecting the dots quickly, Borch, then on her knees, dragged the still biting raccoon, which was scratching frantically at her hand and arms, into the puddle. \n \n \u201cWith my thumb in its mouth, I just pushed its head down into the muck,\u201d Borch said. \n \n With the animal belly-up, she held its head under water. \u201cIt was still struggling and clawing at my arms. It wouldn\u2019t let go of my thumb,\u201d she said. \n \n Borch said she held it there for what felt like an eternity until finally it stopped struggling and \u201cits arms sort of of fell to the side, its chest still heaving really slowly.\u201d \n \n Hyperventilating and in hysterics, she pulled her thumb out of the raccoon\u2019s mouth, \u201cand then I just bolted as fast as I could through the underbrush,\u201d she said. \n \n Borch remembers looking back once to see if the raccoon had started chasing her again. \n \n \u201cIt felt like [Stephen King\u2019s] \u2018Pet Sematary,\u2019\u201d she said. \n \n Kicking her shoes off because they were soaked, Borch ran the three-quarters of a mile home to her house. \n \n Borch, who was screaming and unsure of how rabies affects humans, remembers thinking, \u201cOh, God, what if I just start foaming at the mouth and can\u2019t find my way back?\u201d \n \n She met her mother, Elizabeth, at home, and together they drove immediately to Pen Bay Medical Center. \n \n The dead raccoon was retrieved by Borch\u2019s dad, who packed it into a Taste of the Wild dog food bag and handed it over to the Maine Warden Service. \n \n Hope Animal Control Officer Heidi Blood confirmed Wednesday that the dead raccoon later tested positive for rabies by the Maine Center for Disease Control. \n \n \u201cNot to scare people,\u201d Blood said, but \u201cwhen there\u2019s one [infected], there\u2019s typically another.\u201d \n \n It\u2019s important to \u201clet folks know that just because there\u2019s one [infected] and it\u2019s gone now, doesn\u2019t mean the risk still isn\u2019t there,\u201d she said. \n \n Infected animals typically start showing signs within two weeks, Blood said. Humans can start exhibiting symptoms within a few weeks, she said, but often it takes a few months. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s scary stuff,\u201d Blood said. \u201cThe No. 1 thing we try to remind people of is that it\u2019s 100 percent fatal [if it goes untreated].\u201d \n \n Borch has received six shots so far, including the rabies vaccine, and immunoglobulin and tetanus injections. She is slated to receive her last injection this weekend. \n \n \u201cIf there hadn\u2019t been water on the ground, I don\u2019t know what I would have done,\u201d Borch said of drowning the animal. \u201cIt really was just dumb luck. I\u2019ve never killed an animal with my bare hands. I\u2019m a vegetarian. It was self-defense.\u201d \n \n Her advice for others who find themselves facing a rabid animal? Borch said she has none. \n \n \u201cI always thought of raccoons as this cute, cuddly forest animal,\u201d she said. \u201cI just will never look at them the same way.\u201d \n \n Borch is not the only person to have been attacked by a rabid animal so far this season. \n \n Earlier this week, a Wiscasset man was bitten on both hands in Topsham by what was believed to be a rabid fox. \n \n As of June 7, according to the Maine CDC, there have been 20 animals, including raccoons, red foxes and skunks, that have tested positive for rabies in 2017. \n \n In 2016, 64 animals in Maine tested positive for rabies, according to CDC data. \n \n Loading\u2026 ||||| HOPE \u2014 A woman who was attacked by a rabid raccoon while running in the woods near her home drowned the animal in a puddle after it latched onto her thumb. \n \n Rachel Borch, 21, said she was getting ready to go out for an afternoon run on June 3 when her brother Chris told her to be careful because he had seen a raccoon \u201cskulking\u201d around the yard. He told her he thought it odd that the raccoon, normally a nocturnal animal, was out in the daytime. \n \n Borch said she was running on a fire road next to her house when she encountered the animal. \n \n \u201cOut of nowhere, I see through the underbrush a very ferocious-looking raccoon charging at me with its teeth bared,\u201d Borch said. \n \n She immediately knew something was wrong with the animal by the way it was acting. \n \n \u201cIt was one of those moments like out of the \u2018Twilight Zone\u2019 \u2013 this isn\u2019t real, this doesn\u2019t happen in real life, but then it was right there and it was right at my feet,\u201d she said. \n \n Borch said she started dancing around the animal, frantically trying to figure out what to do. \n \n \u201cThere was nothing I could do, it was going to bite me,\u201d she said. She had dropped her phone and had nothing to protect herself with. \n \n She figured that if it was going to bite her, it might as well be her hands. She put her hands out in front of her, and the raccoon latched onto her thumb. \n \n \u201cI was screaming and crying and trying to hold it down,\u201d she said. \u201cThere was a few inches of really muddy water on the ground \u2013 it was a swampy area of the trail \u2013 so I just took all my strength and pushed it into the water.\u201d \n \n She said she pushed the raccoon\u2019s head underwater and held it there for what seemed like a very long time as it clawed her arms and continued to bite down on her thumb. \n \n \u201cIt happened so fast, but also in slow motion,\u201d Borch said. \n \n The state\u2019s Center for Disease Control and Prevention confirmed June 5 that the raccoon tested positive for rabies. \n \n Rabies is caused by a virus, affects the brain and spinal cord and can cause death if left untreated, according to the Maine CDC. Rabies in people is very rare in the United States, but rabies in animals \u2013 especially wildlife \u2013 is common in most parts of the country, including Maine. \n \n The raccoon continued to move for a while while Borch kept its head underwater. She said she was afraid to let go for fear it would continue attacking her. Eventually, it released its paws and its jaws stopped clenching her thumb. \n \n Bleeding and crying, Borch ran home and screamed for her mother to call 911. Borch\u2019s father, Brad, and her brother retrieved the animal so another animal wouldn\u2019t drag it off and become infected. \n \n Hope animal control officer Heidi Blood said that if one animal tests positive for rabies, it\u2019s \u201calmost 100 percent\u201d certain there are other animals in the area also infected. Blood said that last summer, two raccoons in Lincolnville and one in Hope tested positive for rabies. \n \n Blood said an animal doesn\u2019t have to be aggressive to be infected; it can also act \u201cdelirious or drunklike.\u201d \n \n She said people and their pets should avoid such animals, even dead ones, because the rabies virus can live outside the body for 24 hours. \n \n Under Maine law, cats and dogs, even if they stay indoors, must be vaccinated against the disease. \n \n Borch is expected to receive the last of four rabies shots on Saturday, and has been taking antibiotics for the puncture wounds on her hands. \n \n \u201cYou just can\u2019t predict something like that,\u201d Borch said. \u201cI\u2019m still processing it, but that does not happen and that is not a normal thing.\u201d \n \n Share \n \n Want the news vital to Maine?

Borch, 21, knew immediately that something was wrong with the raccoon that was charging toward her. \"Imagine the Tasmanian devil,\" she tells the Bangor Daily News of the \"terrifying\" June 3 incident. Yanking out her headphones, she began \"dancing\" around the animal on the narrow path, but she tells the Herald she knew that, one way or another, the animal was going to bite her. She figured her hands would be the best spot, so she offered them up. The raccoon chomped down on her thumb and stayed there, scratching at her legs and arms as she screamed. Now on her knees, she spotted her phone lying submerged in a mud puddle, and had an idea: drown it. \"With my thumb in its mouth, I just pushed its head down into the muck,\" she tells the News. When the raccoon finally stopped moving, she yanked out her finger and raced the three-quarters of a mile home. Two days later, the state confirmed the animal was infected with rabies. Borch got rabies shots, and an animal control officer adds an unpleasant footnote: The infected raccoon may not be alone. \"Not to scare people,\" Heidi Blood tells the News, but \"when there\u2019s one, there\u2019s typically another.\" (Normally nocturnal like raccoons, a crazed beaver attacked a woman paddle-boarder.)"

In that short amount of time, they\u2019ve managed to sign up well north of 10 million users, which is amazing. Of course, the easiest path to tens of million of users is to start with hundreds of millions of users. Just ask Buzz or Wave. Still, kudos to Google \u2014 phase one of G+ was clearly a success. \n \n Now comes the hard part. Keeping those users around and engaged. \n \n Some numbers today released by Experian Hitwise suggest that Google+ has already started to experience the sophomore slump.

It\u2019s important to note that this data is U.S.-only, and that Google+ is still technically in limited beta (though it\u2019s easy to get an invite now).

But others I\u2019ve talked to in the past couple weeks have had similar observations. Google+ started off with a bang \u2014 a big one. Part of it was the new car smell, but a bigger part was that expectations were so low for what Google would come up with in the social space (their own doing). When Google exceeded those expectations, people were genuinely surprised. And that also spurred usage. There was a sense of excitement: Could this really be the next big social network? \n \n But now things are calming down. The new car smell is wearing off. And it\u2019s time for reality. \n \n Google gave users a compelling reason to sign up, now they need to provide a compelling reason for coming back. That\u2019s a lot easier said than done. Just ask Twitter. User retention is a bitch. \n \n Google has their secret weapon: the (ugly) black toolbar that resides across all of their properties. If it weren\u2019t for that thing, my usage of Google+ would be once a day instead of twice a day. But even that won\u2019t matter in the long run if Google doesn\u2019t have the network and the content to back up G+. In addition to an overall traffic dip, average time spent on the site was down 10 percent, Hitwise says. That\u2019s not good. \n \n From what I\u2019ve seen, Hangouts are the major strong point of Google+ retention right now. While Sparks seem to be a major weak point. \n \n Circles, while initially praised for their simplicity and design, are now also facing backlash. The fact of the matter is that they\u2019re a pain in the ass to maintain \u2014 just like every other type of list. And aside from \u201cFriends\u201d, \u201cFamily\u201d, and maybe \u201cCo-Workers\u201d, it\u2019s still not clear how they\u2019re being used, or if usage will continue. Well, aside from the Robert Scoble Circle. That is useful. \n \n Meanwhile, after an initial amazing burst, traffic referred from Google+ is dropping. And fast. Obviously, I can only speak to the TechCrunch data here. But again, the trend is clear. Each of the past three weeks, we\u2019ve been seeing less and less traffic referred. And that\u2019s with the overall network supposedly growing. \n \n Part of that may be Google\u2019s own fault. They really screwed up the brand situation. They even gutted one of our employees who just wanted to share content. \n \n It would be hard to overstate just how important this second phase of Google+ is for Google. While they\u2019re not a small startup limited by resources and money, they still only get one chance to make a first impression. In the first two weeks, that impression was very good. In the last two, not as good. \n \n I\u2019m sure this post will get a hundred comments on Google+ about why I\u2019m wrong, an idiot, something about Apple, and why Google+ is the bomb. I\u2019d argue that this may be a part of the overall problem \u2014 one we\u2019ve seen before. But that\u2019s beside the point. It doesn\u2019t matter what anyone says. All that matters is what Google does with Google+.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Less than a month after its big launch, Google+ has hit its first minus: Usage declined 3% to 1.79 million visits last week, reports Bloomberg. What's more, time spent on the new social media site dropped 10%, falling to 5 minutes to 15 seconds. It's important to note Experian Hitwise's numbers include neither international nor mobile web traffic, and Google+ is technically still in \"limited beta,\" writes MG Siegler of Techcrunch. But when your prime competition has 750 million users, any setback can be daunting. Since making its debut June 28, Google+ quickly rose to 20 million users in just three weeks. \"There was a sense of excitement: Could this really be the next big social network?\" writes Siegler. But \"after initially checking it several times a day, I now load Google+ about twice a day, mainly to see if I\u2019m missing anything. I rarely find that I am. I +1 a few things here and there, maybe leave a comment. But overall, the content feels fairly stale. The new car smell is wearing off. And it\u2019s time for reality.\" And that reality? \"User retention is a bitch,\" says Siegler."

(Photo: Ryan Garza Detroit Free Press)Buy Photo \n \n Dave Brown had scoured the Vietnam Veterans Memorial in Washington looking for his Army basic training buddy Roger Watson's name. \n \n While in Vietnam in 1968, Brown ran into someone from Watson's company and heard that his friend had been injured. \n \n The word was true \u2014 Watson was shot March 8, 1968, seven months into his tour, losing a kidney and 3 feet of small intestine and suffering damage to his liver. \n \n But Brown never found out if his friend lived or died. \n \n The two men \u2014 who came from the same northwest Detroit neighborhood, were drafted on the same day in 1966, trained together at Ft. Hood in Texas, served in the 9th Infantry and were combat engineer demolition specialists \u2014 never saw or heard from each other again. \n \n Until right before Halloween this year. \n \n That's when the two men \u2014 more than 40 years older than the last time they saw each other as young soldiers in training \u2014 walked across their kitty-corner backyards in Berkley and met at the chain-link fence. \n \n For 18 years, the two Oakland County men had lived nearly back to back and didn't even know it. \n \n Weeks after reuniting, they still can't believe it. \n \n Vietnam vets and long-lost friends David Brown and Roger Watson of Berkley found out they have been neighbors for 18 years. Ryan Garza/Detroit Free Press \n \n \"I was absolutely delighted,\" Brown, 68, a retired surveyor, said of learning about Watson, grateful his friend survived. \"I wondered about you for 40 years.\" \n \n \"I always wondered what happened to you,\" Watson, 67, a retired supervisor with the Michigan Department of Corrections, told Brown as the two sat in Watson's home recently, sipping coffee, sharing war stories and telling their amazing reunion story. \n \n That story is a story in itself. \n \n And it's thanks to Brown's wife, Peggy, who has been neighborly with Watson because of their common interest in birds. \n \n Peggy Brown was taking a walk one day when she noticed the Purple Heart license plate on Watson's car and mentioned it to her husband. On another occasion, she noticed the 9th Infantry Vietnam Veterans cap in the rear window of the car. \n \n Then, on Oct. 27, the revelation happened \u2014 during e-mail exchanges between her and Watson that began about a picture of a hawk. \n \n \"On a different subject my husband Dave was in the ninth infantry 15th combat engineers' 1967-1968 Vietnam. Wondering if you were there at that time. \u2026 I saw that you were in the ninth,\" she wrote Watson. \n \n The back-and-forth e-mails that followed unraveled answers to questions pondered by both men for four decades. \n \n \"Small World!!!!!!\" and \"Wow !!!!\" and questions, such as whether Watson's nickname was Bunny (it wasn't) and if Dave Brown's hair was blond (it was), were sprinkled through the evolving exchanges. \n \n \"I think we may have volunteered together,\" Watson wrote Peggy Brown. \"Please don't believe any stories he may tell about me! Also let him know I've changed a lot since basic.\" \n \n After looking at photos of the men as soldiers via e-mail that day, Peggy Brown wrote: \"This has to be coincidence of the century. Dave cannot believe all this and we've been here for 18 years in Berkley. What are the odds?\" \n \n That's been the reaction of the men, their wives and the friends they've told since the long-lost Army buddies found each other again. \n \n \"It takes one little piece of information to put the whole thing together,\" said Watson's wife, Edie. \n \n Roger Watson said he saw only glimpses of his neighbor from a distance now and then through the years. \n \n When the foliage is out, both couples said, it's impossible to see into each others' backyards. Roger Watson said he simply was friends with Peggy Brown \"over the fence\" as both of them fed the birds. \n \n \"I was almost shaken,\" Roger Watson said of learning his Army buddy was his neighbor. \"This is almost too wild.\" \n \n \"This is incredible,\" Dave Brown said. \"It's amazing. So much time has elapsed.\" \n \n But to hear the men \u2014 now longtime husbands, fathers and grandfathers \u2014 talk recently, it was like no time had passed at all. \n \n They recalled being drafted, training in Texas \u2014 running everywhere, cleaning the barracks and spit-shining shoes \u2014 and leaving for life-changing experiences in Vietnam while their hometown of Detroit was experiencing its own life-changing event in the 1967 riot. \n \n Watson talked about when he was shot; Brown recalled the first body he encountered as a soldier. \n \n The experiences are among many etched in the memories of both men \u2014 memories neither can shed, just like the smell of diesel or the sound of a helicopter. \n \n Now, they have another memory \u2014 discovering each other. \n \n \"It's sort of amazing we've been neighbors this long,\" Watson said. \n \n Brown agreed. \n \n \"It's just great to see him alive,\" he said. \"It makes me happy.\" \n \n Read or Share this story: http://on.freep.com/1BaPhDJ",

        "Document": "Sen. Marco Rubio (R., Fla.) suggested that any decisions about whether to run again for his seat would not come until the weekend at the earliest. Earlier this week, Mr. Rubio opened the door to another run, saying that the shooting massacre in Orlando on Sunday had led him to consider how he might best [\u2026] ||||| Friends for 20 years, Marco Rubio and Florida Lt. Gov. Carlos Lopez-Cantera were at the scene of the Orlando massacre on Sunday when they had an unusually frank conversation about their political futures. \n \n \u201cYou should reconsider running for your seat,\u201d Lopez-Cantera told Rubio as they sat in the senator\u2019s pickup truck about an hour before sunset, after witnessing the aftermath of the deadliest mass shooting in U.S. history. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n Rubio was caught off guard. After all, Lopez-Cantera has been running for his Senate seat in a crowded GOP primary for more than a year \u2014 with Rubio\u2019s encouragement. \n \n Lopez-Cantera made clear he was still fully committed to running, even as he initiated a gut-check moment for both of them. Until then, Rubio had resisted the entreaties of Senate leaders and donors to rethink retiring from the Senate. Lopez-Cantera\u2019s conversation removed one of the biggest obstacles to Rubio running again: a longtime friendship that he wouldn\u2019t want to ruin due to political ambition. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to say that because of outside pressure,\u201d Rubio responded. \n \n But Lopez-Cantera said he felt \u201ccompelled\u201d to continue talking it through. The two of them were shaken by what they saw in Orlando, the bloody sidewalks and the ashen faces of local, state and federal authorities. \n \n \u201cThis is bigger than me. And this isn\u2019t about me. And it\u2019s not about you. It\u2019s about our country and this election,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said to Rubio, recounting the conversation for Politico. \u201cIt\u2019s deeply consequential. \u2026 In the current field, I\u2019m the best candidate in the general election. But I\u2019m not looking at this through rose-colored glasses.\u201d \n \n Bottom line, Lopez-Cantera said in the interview: \u201cNothing has changed. I\u2019m still running. Marco isn\u2019t.\u201d \n \n The filing deadline for the race is June 24, when Rubio is scheduled to hold a fundraiser for Lopez-Cantera. If Rubio decides to run, Lopez-Cantera won\u2019t file. Right now, longtime friends of both men believe Rubio ultimately won\u2019t run: The lure of a much bigger paycheck and proximity to his family will outweigh another term in the Senate. \n \n But in the next breath, they say no one really knows what Rubio will do, except the senator himself \u2014 and even he might still be agonizing over the decision. \n \n \u201cI\u2019ll go home later this week, I\u2019ll have some time with my family,\u201d Rubio told reporters in the Capitol on Wednesday as he headed to a classified briefing on the Orlando attacks. \u201cIf there\u2019s been a change in our status, I\u2019ll be sure to let everyone know.\u201d \n \n Polling shows Rubio is the strongest Republican in a potential race against the Democrats\u2019 strongest candidate, Rep. Patrick Murphy, in a contest that could decide control of the Senate. \n \n The Republican Senate race is crowded. And the full-court press to recruit Rubio to run for reelection has frozen fundraising and dampened Republican enthusiasm for all five major GOP candidates for the seat. None is as well known as Rubio. \n \n Some Republican and conservative groups have suggested they won\u2019t spend big in Florida, while more donors will give to oppose Rubio in order to hand him his second defeat in a year and brand him a double loser after his crushing loss in the presidential primary. \n \n As part of the maneuvers to get Rubio to reverse course, Lopez-Cantera and allies of his and Rubio\u2019s say the amount of disinformation spread by party insiders has been somewhere between staggering and absurd. \n \n For weeks, Lopez-Cantera and Rubio had privately mocked the rumors of them striking a deal or hatching some elaborate plot. In one telling, Rubio would run for reelection, win and then resign before the 2020 presidential election cycle, at which point Lopez-Cantera would run for his seat. In another version, Lopez-Cantera agreed with moneyed interests to drop out of the Senate race, endorse Rubio and then run for chief financial officer in 2018. \n \n All of it is false, Lopez-Cantera said. \n \n \u201cThere is no deal. There is no plan,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said. \u201cNone of it is true. Anyone who says that is lying and doesn\u2019t know what they\u2019re talking about.\u201d \n \n But those who haven\u2019t been privy to the two friends\u2019 talks have been deeply skeptical about what they\u2019re up to. And if Rubio ultimately runs and Lopez-Cantera doesn\u2019t, some of the rumors will appear true. \n \n \u201cYou can\u2019t tell me this hasn\u2019t been orchestrated,\u201d said one Republican who supports one of Lopez-Cantera\u2019s rivals in the Senate race said, echoing Democrats. \u201cMarco is running and you can talk about all the friendship stuff you want, but this shows Marco is all about Marco.\u201d \n \n The campaign of one of Lopez-Cantera\u2019s Republican opponents, developer Carlos Beruff, fell for one of the rumor-filled reports and issued a statement Wednesday about Rubio in which the candidate said voters are \u201csick of career politicians and power brokers in Washington who care about one thing: holding on to power. But the voters of Florida will not obey them. They don\u2019t get to pick our candidates.\u201d \n \n As for the other Republican candidates, U.S. Rep. David Jolly said he\u2019ll announce his plans Friday. He might run for reelection to his Tampa Bay-area 13th Congressional District seat. Defense contractor Todd Wilcox indicated he\u2019ll stay in the race with or without Rubio, and those close to U.S. Rep. Ron DeSantis say he\u2019d give strong consideration to running for reelection in the 6th Congressional District if Rubio runs. \n \n Lopez-Cantera acknowledges that his decision to bring up the race \u2014 especially after witnessing the aftermath of the carnage at the Pulse nightclub \u2014 put unexpected extra pressure on Rubio. \n \n Rubio\u2019s plans since last spring were to win the White House or return home to West Miami, where he lives less than a half-hour away from Lopez-Cantera\u2019s Coral Gables home. Rubio has hired Washington dealmaker Robert Barnett to field job offers and get the biggest payday possible, without lobbying or working on Wall Street. He also planned to hit the paid-speaker circuit. \n \n After two years, if Hillary Clinton wins this election, Rubio is expected to begin mounting a challenge to her in 2020. \n \n \u201cMarco ran for president as a senator and we saw how that played out,\u201d said one backer. \u201cThis is his chance to be at home, spend time with Jeannette [Rubio\u2019s wife] and their kids and make some real money so he can put all four of them through private college in the Northeast if he wants to. People forget he\u2019s the son of blue-collar immigrants. Things like this are more important to him than politics.\u201d \n \n Lopez-Cantera, who is also married and has two children, emphasized the importance of family to Rubio. \n \n \u201cUntil I mentioned this, he was really committed to spending time with his kids, being able to be home for more than 10 days without having to go somewhere on the campaign trail or back to Washington. He looked forward to coaching his son\u2019s football team,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said. \n \n Miami-Dade County Commissioner Steve Bovo, whose wife works as a policy adviser for Rubio, said he wasn\u2019t surprised by Lopez-Cantera\u2019s discussion. Bovo served in the Florida House when Lopez-Cantera was majority leader just after Rubio left as Florida House speaker, a post he held in 2007-08. \n \n \u201cCarlos is not only thinking about their friendship but the country,\u201d Bovo said. \u201cWe all know each other, go to each others\u2019 kids\u2019 birthday parties. In the difficult business we\u2019re in, we separate the friendship and the politics. But we never do anything to endanger our friendship.\u201d \n \n One Rubio insider said he believes Rubio should run for reelection because, as a senator, he\u2019ll have more ability to affect policy he cares about, raise money and draw attention. \n \n \u201cFrom a political perspective, this is about having a platform,\u201d the Republican said. \u201cWhen CNN calls, does the booker want former Sen. Marco Rubio or do they want, say, current Sen. Tom Cotton?\u201d \n \n A member of the Committee on Foreign Relations and Select Committee on Intelligence, Rubio has made foreign policy a specialty. And, friends say, he\u2019ll miss getting classified briefings and being in a position to do something about it. \n \n About 12 hours after Rubio and Lopez-Cantera spoke on Sunday, the senator was interviewed by conservative radio show host Hugh Hewitt, who likes to talk about foreign policy and the threat of terrorism. Hewitt unexpectedly switched gears on Rubio by asking whether the terrorist attack changed \u201cin any way your resolve not to seek reelection.\u201d \n \n Briefly caught flat-footed, Rubio said \u201cI\u2019ve been deeply impacted by it. I think when it visits your home state, and it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about, you know, your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country.\u201d \n \n \u201cI have a friend of mine who is running for the U.S. Senate,\u201d Rubio said later. \u201cSo I want to be fair, Hugh. I haven\u2019t thought about it in that context. I really don\u2019t want to link the two things right now, because I don\u2019t want politics to intrude in all of this.\u201d \n \n By then, though, it was too late. \n \n \u201cI brought this up. It wasn\u2019t mutual,\u201d Lopez-Cantera said. \u201cHe is in a position where he will make a decision. We\u2019re friends. We support each other.\u201d \n \n \n \n \n \n Seung Min Kim contributed to this report. \n \n",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 The main obstacle keeping Marco Rubio from seeking re-election to his Senate seat just disappeared. The prospect of Rubio doing so gained traction in the wake of the Orlando shooting, but he continued to insist that he wouldn't run against his friend already in the race, Carlos Lopez-Cantera. Now, however, Lopez-Cantera himself is publicly giving Rubio the all-clear, reports Politico. He says he and Rubio discussed it in recent days, with Lopez-Cantera encouraging him to consider changing his mind. \u201cI don\u2019t want you to feel like you have to say that because of outside pressure,\u201d he quotes Rubio as responding. The incumbent told reporters on Wednesday that he'd go home this week to spend time with his family and consider his next steps. Rumors are swirling that the pair have some sort of plan\u2014perhaps for Rubio to win the seat over a Democrat (Republicans believe he has the best shot), then resign and allow Lopez-Cantera to run before the 2020 presidential campaign. But Lopez-Cantera says that's not the case. \"Until I mentioned this, he was really committed to spending time with his kids, being able to be home for more than 10 days without having to go somewhere,\" he says. As of now, \"nothing has changed,\u201d he adds. \"I'm still running. Marco isn't.\" Rubio's decision isn\u2019t expected until the weekend at the earliest, per the Wall Street Journal; he has until June 24 to file for re-election. If he does so, Lopez-Cantera won't run, says Politico."

Gionet, apparently at wit\u2019s end, dealt with the loss the only way he knew how: by livestreaming his breakdown an an In-N-Out Burger and randomly screaming at innocent passersby. \n \n Advertisement \n \n But Laura Loomer, an ex-employee of Project Veritas, James O\u2019Keefe\u2019s right-wing sting operation, but who\u2019s probably best known for crashing a New York City performance of \u201cJulius Caesar\u201d to own the libs, took the loss of her verification especially hard, suggesting, of course, that this is basically just how that movie about the Holocaust begins. \n \n Advertisement \n \n When a verified Twitter user ironically responded that, perhaps, something happening on the internet is not at all like the genocide claimed the lives of six million Jews, Loomer doubled down magnificently: \n \n Although neo-Nazi figures like Richard Spencer and Jason Kessler, who organized the white supremacist rally that turned deadly in Charlottesville, were stripped of their verification, they remain active on the site. So like most things Twitter does to appear like it\u2019s addressing harassment and abuse on the site, the move so far seems mostly like an effort to stop appearing to tacitly endorse the worst people online\u2014without actually barring them from the service that\u2019s in no small part contributed to their rise. ||||| Breaking News Emails Get breaking news alerts and special reports. The news and stories that matter, delivered weekday mornings. \n \n / Updated By Chelsea Bailey \n \n Conservative commentator Laura Loomer was banned from using Uber and Lyft after she posted a series of anti-Muslim tweets following the terrorist attack in New York. \n \n A spokesman for the ride-hailing service Lyft confirmed Thursday that Loomer's account had been \"deactivated\" following her daylong tweetstorm that blamed Islam and Muslims for the deadly attack. \n \n A representative for Uber also confirmed that Loomer was banned permanently from using the service. \n \n Loomer launched into an anti-Muslim rant on Twitter Wednesday, calling for a new ride sharing company to be created that didn't employ Muslims, after it was revealed that Sayfullo Saipov, the suspect in the New York terror attack, was a former Uber driver. \n \n \"Someone needs to create a non Islamic form of Uber or Lyft because I never want to support another Islamic immigrant driver,\" Loomer tweeted, tagging both companies in the post. \n \n The tweet marked the beginning of a daylong anti-Islamic social media attack that blamed all Muslims for ISIS terrorism. Loomer also posted a photo of two women wearing hijabs near the intersection where Tuesday's attacks occurred, writing \u201cI bet they\u2019re loving this.\u201d \n \n Hours later, she re-tweeted reports that she\u2019d been banned from both ride-sharing services. The 24-year-old has responded to the ban by announcing that she will be taking legal action against both companies. \n \n Related: Milo Yiannopoulos' 'Free Speech' Week Canceled \n \n \u201cUber will literally hire an Islamic terrorist, but they will ban a conservative journalist for addressing legitimate safety concerns,\u201d she tweeted. \n \n The backlash to Loomer's rant was swift and vocal, with many critics accusing the online agitator of stoking racism in the wake of a tragedy. Celebrities also criticized Loomer\u2019s posts, with model Gigi Hadid tweeting that she\u2019s a \"f***ing moron,\" and actress Alyssa Milano posting that she\u2019d reported Loomer to Twitter for hate speech. \n \n The blowback seemed to embolden Loomer, who continued tweeting about the ban Thursday. \n \n Loomer describes herself as an independent journalist, but many of her critics have labeled her a vocal member of the alt-right. She previously worked for Project Veritas, which is run by far-right political activist James O'Keefe. ||||| Tweet with a location \n \n You can add location information to your Tweets, such as your city or precise location, from the web and via third-party applications.

        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 A few Twitter users lost the coveted blue tick on Wednesday after Twitter released new guidelines regarding verified accounts. The move came after the company was attacked for granting verified status to Jason Kessler, who put together the white nationalist rally that rocked Charlottesville in August (and issued this \"vile\" tweet about victim Heather Heyer). In a series of tweets, Twitter explained that \"verification was meant to authenticate identity & voice ... [but] verification has long been perceived as an endorsement. We gave verified accounts visual prominence on the service which deepened this perception. We should have addressed this earlier but did not prioritize the work as we should have.\" General verification requests had been put on ice as of Nov. 9 pending a review of the program, and the Guardian reports that Twitter's new policy specifies that accounts that promote hate, support hate groups, or harass users will see verification revoked. Among those to immediately lose the check, per the Washington Post, were Kessler, white nationalist Richard Spencer, and far-right activist Laura Loomer (known for rushing the stage during Julius Caesar and being banned from Uber and Lyft after anti-Muslim tweets). Loomer's response to her notice of verification removal including tweeting \"Translation: I'm a conservative\" and, per Splinter, comparing her situation to that of Jews during the Holocaust."

The very first question: \u201cWhat books are on your nightstand?\u201d Walker replied with four, the second of which was: \n \n \u201cAnd the Truth Shall Set You Free,\u201d by David Icke. In Icke\u2019s books there is the whole of existence, on this planet and several others, to think about. A curious person\u2019s dream come true. \n \n This passed without comment from the New York Times interviewer, and the publication passed it on to readers without qualification. This is rather remarkable because the book is an unhinged anti-Semitic conspiracy tract written by one of Britain\u2019s most notorious anti-Semites. \n \n A former soccer player turned professional hate peddler, Icke is one of the most influential conspiracy theorists in Europe, and certainly in Britain. Today, he has over 777,000 followers on Facebook, and speaks to audiences around the world. Like many conspiracy theorists, Icke claims that a secret conspiracy controls the world. And like many conspiracy theorists, Icke claims that this secret conspiracy happens to be Jewish. In And the Truth Shall Set You Free, the word \u201cJewish\u201d appears 241 times, and the name \u201cRothschild\u201d is mentioned 374 times. These references are not compliments. Indeed, the book was so obviously anti-Semitic that Icke\u2019s publisher refused to publish it, and he had to print it himself. \n \n In the book and elsewhere, Icke draws liberally upon the infamous anti-Semitic pamphlet, The Protocols of the Elders of Zion\u2014a Russian forgery about an alleged global Jewish cabal that is widely considered one of the most influential anti-Semitic works in history. Magnanimously, Icke calls the hate tract by a different name. As he writes in the book promoted by Alice Walker: \n \n In the very late 1800s, a controversial document came to light called the Protocols Of The Elders Of Zion. I call them the Illuminati Protocols and I quote many extracts from them in The Robots\u2019 Rebellion. Some say they were a forgery made public only to discredit Jews, and I use the term \u2018Illuminati Protocols\u2019 to get away from the Jewish emphasis. If they were a forgery, something that is quite possible, what were they a forgery of, and by whom? The authors of the best-selling book, Holy Blood, Holy Grail, conclude that the original Protocols were indeed authentic. \n \n Realizing that this may not convince readers of his good intentions, Icke attempts to head off charges of anti-Semitism by casting himself as a moderate in the reasonable debate over whether a Jewish conspiracy does in fact control the world: \n \n I believe that researchers over the years who have blamed the entire conspiracy on the Jewish people as a whole are seriously misguided; similarly, for Jewish organisations to deny that any Jewish person is working for the New World Order conspiracy is equally naive and allowing dogma or worse to blind them to reality. \n \n So, is Icke anti-Semitic? Well, here are some other things that he says in the book: \n \n \u2022 The Talmud is \u201camong the most appallingly racist documents on the planet.\u201d \n \n \u2022 B\u2019nai Brith, the world\u2019s oldest Jewish service organization, was behind the slave trade (an anti-Semitic canard popularized by Louis Farrakhan) and controls the Ku Klux Klan: \u201cB\u2019nai B\u2019rith means \u2018Sons of the Alliance\u2019 (Ed: Actually, \u2018Children of the Covenant\u2019) and was established in 1843. Many of its speakers openly supported slavery during the American Civil War and it covertly supports and controls the Ku Klux Klan.\u201d \n \n \u2022 Racist far-right groups are actually Jewish fronts. \u201cIn Britain,\u201d he writes, \u201cI am told by an extremely reliable source very close to the intelligence organisations that the \u2018far Right\u2019 group, Combat 18, is a front for the sinister Anti-Defamation League, the United States and of the \u2018Israeli\u2019/Rothschild secret service, Mossad. The Anti-Defamation League (ADL) has been operating in Britain and Europe since at least 1991 and its role is to brand as anti-Semitic anyone who is getting close to the truth of what is going on. What better way to discredit an investigator than to have a \u2018far Right\u2019 group like Combat 18 to praise them?\u201d (The \u201c18\u201d in \u201cCombat 18\u201d refers to the first and eighth letters of the alphabet: A and H, for Adolf Hitler.) \n \n \u2022 Jews are behind anti-Semitic attacks: \u201cIf you really want to discredit someone, you arrange for anti-Jewish or anti-whatever events such as the smashing of graves, assaults on people, even a terrorist bomb in the extreme. You then point the finger at your target person or group. You say they are either directly responsible or \u2018incited\u2019 the actions by what they are writing and saying.\u201d \n \n \u2022 Quotes and seconds the heinous assertion of Gary Allen\u2014the John Birch Society spokesman and former George Wallace speechwriter\u2014that Jews bankrolled their own extermination in the Holocaust: \n \n The Jewish members of the conspiracy have used an organisation called The Anti-Defamation League as an instrument to try to convince everyone that any mention of the Rothschilds and their allies is an attack on all Jews. In this way they have stifled almost all honest scholarship on international bankers and made the subject taboo within universities. Any individual or book exploring this subject is immediately attacked by hundreds of ADL communities all over the country. The ADL has never let the truth or logic interfere with its highly professional smear jobs \u2026 Actually, nobody has a right to be more angry at the Rothschild clique than their fellow Jews. The Warburgs, part of the Rothschild empire, helped finance Adolf Hitler. \n \n \u2022 Equates the anti-Semitic Nazi media of the Third Reich with a company that closed down a publication after it printed Holocaust denial: \u201cWhat is the difference between the controlled anti-Jewish media under Hitler and the way the Japanese magazine, Marco Polo, was closed down by its parent company in 1995 because of a campaign by the global Jewish hierarchy to stop its advertising revenue after it published an article questioning some of the official stories of the Nazi concentration camps?\u201d \n \n \u2022 Calls on schools to teach the controversy about whether the Holocaust really happened: \u201cWhy do we play a part in suppressing alternative information to the official line of the Second World War? How is it right that while this fierce suppression goes on, free copies of the Spielberg film, Schindler\u2019s List, are given to schools to indoctrinate children with the unchallenged version of events? And why do we, who say we oppose tyranny and demand freedom of speech, allow people to go to prison and be vilified, and magazines to be closed down on the spot, for suggesting another version of history?\u201d \n \n (Icke never does explain how Jews could have funded the Holocaust if the Holocaust didn\u2019t actually happen.) \n \n As can be seen from these extracts, and the chapter titles of the work (\u201cMaster Races,\u201d \u201cThe Hidden Hand\u201d), anti-Semitism is not incidental to Icke\u2019s book, it is essential. It is impossible to miss it. (And we have not even touched on Icke\u2019s climate change denial, 9/11 trutherism, and anti-vaccination misinformation.) \n \n This is the book that Alice Walker recommended to New York Times readers. \n \n That a celebrated cultural figure like Walker would promote such a self-evidently unhinged bigot might seem surprising at first glance. But this is only because the cultural establishment has spent years studiously looking away from Walker\u2019s praise of Icke and his work, and her repeated expressions of anti-Semitism. \n \n Back in June 2013, Walker wrote an effusive blog post showering accolades on Icke and his book Human Race Get off Your Knees. \u201cIt\u2019s an amazing book, HUMAN RACE GET OFF YOUR KNEES,\u201d she enthused, \u201cand reading it was the ultimate reading adventure. I felt it was the first time I was able to observe, and mostly imagine and comprehend, the root of the incredible evil that has engulfed our planet.\u201d \n \n In May 2013, Walker told the BBC\u2019s Desert Island Discs that if she could have only one book, it would be Icke\u2019s Human Race. \n \n In December 2013, Walker offered end-of-year thanks to an array of \u201cbeloved humans who\u2019ve stuck their necks out for the collective.\u201d One of them was David Icke, whose Human Race Get off Your Knees book also got its own entry. \n \n In July 2015, Walker shared an interview between David Icke and Alex Jones, his American analogue. The account that posted the video has since been banned from YouTube. \n \n In September 2016, Walker promoted a lecture of Icke\u2019s to her readers, writing, \u201cI decided to find, among Icke\u2019s numerous videos, one lecture that might offer an introduction that wouldn\u2019t be too scary for folks leery of being nudged in a direction of inquiry that might upset, destroy possibly, their worldview. I think this one might fit the bill.\u201d YouTube has since taken down that lecture. \n \n In November 2017, Walker posted an explicitly anti-Semitic \u201cpoem\u201d on her blog titled, \u201cIt Is Our (Frightful) Duty to Study the Talmud.\u201d The composition blames all the world\u2019s ills, from Israel to America, on the ancient Aramaic compendium of Jewish law and lore, and checks nearly every anti-Semitic box, from attacking Jews as Christ-killers to claiming that Jews view gentiles as \u201csub-human.\u201d A representative excerpt: \n \n For the study of Israel, of Gaza, of Palestine, \n \n Of the bombed out cities of the Middle East, \n \n Of the creeping Palestination \n \n Of our police, streets, and prisons \n \n In America, \n \n Of war in general, \n \n It is our duty, I believe, to study The Talmud. \n \n It is within this book that, \n \n I believe, we will find answers \n \n To some of the questions \n \n That most perplex us. Where to start? You will find some information, \n \n Slanted, unfortunately, \n \n By Googling. For a more in depth study \n \n I recommend starting with YouTube. Simply follow the trail of \u201cThe \n \n Talmud\u201d as its poison belatedly winds its way \n \n Into our collective consciousness. Some of what you find will sound \n \n Too crazy to be true. Unfortunately those bits are likely \n \n To be true. Some of the more evasive studies \n \n Will exhibit unbelievable attempts \n \n At sugar coating extremely disagreeable pills. \n \n But hang in there, checking \n \n And double checking, listening to everybody, \n \n Even the teachers with the twisted pasts \n \n That scare you the most, \n \n And the taped rants of outraged citizens that sound \n \n Like madcap characters on Car Talk \n \n Except they are not laughing \n \n But are righteously outraged. Study hard, with an open \n \n If deeply offended mind, \n \n Until you can sift the false \n \n From the true. Is Jesus boiling eternally in hot excrement, \n \n For his \u201ccrime\u201d of throwing the bankers \n \n Out of the Temple? For loving, standing with, \n \n And defending \n \n The poor? Was his mother, Mary, \n \n A whore? Are Goyim (us) meant to be slaves of Jews, and not only \n \n That, but to enjoy it? \n \n Are three year old (and a day) girls eligible for marriage and intercourse? \n \n Are young boys fair game for rape? \n \n Must even the best of the Goyim (us, again) be killed? \n \n Pause a moment and think what this could mean \n \n Or already has meant \n \n In our own lifetime. \n \n Anti-Semitic slanders of the Talmud\u2019s contents are almost as old as the Talmud itself, and are one reason why Albert Einstein advocated that it be translated into English, \u201cin order to cut the ground from under certain malevolent attacks, of anti-Semitic origin, which borrow countenance from the obscurity and inaccessibility of certain passages in the Talmud.\u201d Clearly, Einstein did not anticipate the likes of YouTube-educated Talmud scholars like Alice Walker. \n \n And yet, despite all of this, Walker has never been held accountable by elite cultural critics for repeatedly promoting Icke and anti-Semitism. In fact, this is not even the first time the New York Times helped give her a coveted and uncritical platform: in 2015, New York Times theater reporter Michael Paulson interviewed Walker at the New School to mark the premiere of The Color Purple musical revival on Broadway. He did not ask her about anti-Semitism, despite collecting questions in advance on Twitter, several of which raised the issue, likely because it would have been too uncomfortable. \n \n Normally, this is where I\u2019d say that it was good that the Times published Walker\u2019s Icke recommendation because it lets us know who she is. But we have known who she is for many years. It is rather the Times and other cultural elites who have opted to ignore this inconvenient fact. Thus, the only thing that is accomplished by uncritically disseminating Walker\u2019s bigoted book bon mots is ensuring that the racism is disseminated to more people. \n \n Why has Walker escaped accountability for so long? Perhaps it is due to her Israel politics, which have been used to confuse the issue. Walker is a prominent supporter of the Boycott, Divestment, and Sanctions (BDS) movement against Israel, famously forbidding The Color Purple from being translated into the language of Hebrew. Because Walker\u2014like Icke\u2014is a strident critic of Israel, her defenders\u2014like Icke\u2019s\u2014have dismissed allegations of anti-Semitism by claiming they are merely an attempt to quash her criticism of the Jewish state. \n \n But it should not surprise anyone that the world\u2019s only Jewish state, home to half its Jews, would attract the attention of anti-Semites, who would use the legitimate debate over its conduct to smuggle in their anti-Jewish bile. Anti-Zionism may not be anti-Semitism, but plenty of self-described anti-Zionists are anti-Semites. A progressive left that is serious about anti-Semitism will call it out not only when it comes from a white supremacist and is presented as \u201crace realism,\u201d but when it comes from their own camp and is presented in the righteous guise of \u201canti-Zionism.\u201d \n \n Not publishing anti-Semitic book recommendations unchallenged in the New York Times would be a good place to start. \n \n Yair Rosenberg is a senior writer at Tablet.

They had no place in their psyches to fathom their abuse: Subjected to every kind of depravity and horror, during the passage and after, they arrived to be forced onto platforms and bid on, a process that could drag on and on, as plantation owners rejected those for whom they had no use. Africans were \u201cbroken in\u201d physically, and broken down spiritually, to such an extent they became what they had not been in their homelands or halfway through the voyage: slaves. This treatment, deliberately calibrated to destroy their inner sovereignty, was called \u201cseasoning.\u201d In Daniel Black\u2019s extraordinary book \u201cThe Coming,\u201d we have an unprecedented opportunity to be with ancestors who probably never dreamed a scribe would one day appear to make their descendants not only imagine their plight but also, by being brought to tears by the narrative, gain access to an emotion that makes us one with them. Shamanic work. \n \n What moves you most in a book? \n \n The witnessing of a great soul. A magnificent spirit in action. A warrior whose mental weapons seem to come equally from heart and air, and whose soul is nourished by solitude and dreams. In other words, the writer\u2019s courage. \n \n Did you read poetry as a child? \n \n We owned two or three thick volumes of English literature called \u201cProse and Poetry.\u201d I wish I knew where they are now! They were the foundation of the family\u2019s literacy and love of literature. \u201cIf you can keep your head when all about you are losing theirs and blaming it on you.\u2026\u201d The refrain was: \u201cYou\u2019ll be a man, my son.\u201d But I ignored the \u201cman\u201d part. I knew I was being spoken directly to, and this has turned out to be true. I have gone my own way, because of that early impression that it is right to do so. Poetry is that kind of gift. \n \n I was also strengthened by the love the people in my community had for poetry. They appreciated my first poem: \u201cEaster lilies pure and white, blossom in the morning light.\u201d Their praise, when I was 3 or 4, gave me permission to be a poet, with all the intrigue and adventure that would later involve. Well, if only they knew! \n \n Was there a book of poems or a poet in particular that inspired you to write? \n \n I loved Emily Dickinson. Robert Frost. T. S. Eliot. Paul Laurence Dunbar. Langston Hughes. Margaret Walker\u2019s \u201cFor My People\u201d moved me deeply. Also her poems \u201cOctober Journeys\u201d and \u201cWe Have Been Believers.\u201d But no, I think sorrow more than poets inspired me to write. That and the most rapt love of nature all around me, that seemed to require something creative from me to attempt to match \u2014 a gold and crimson leaf, perhaps, or the way a turtle\u2019s shell fits perfectly, or the notion that horses, though heavy, could swim!

        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 The New York Times is standing by its Q&A with Pulitzer-winning author Alice Walker despite complaints about her comments on a book by an accused anti-Semite. The 74-year-old author of The Color Purple told the newspaper's By the Book column that was she was currently reading David Icke's And the Truth Shall Set You Free and called it \"a curious person's dream come true.\" At Tablet, Yair Rosenberg writes that the book referencing The Protocols of the Elders of Zion, a text accusing Jewish people of a plot for global domination, \"is an unhinged anti-Semitic conspiracy tract written by one of Britain's most notorious anti-Semites.\" The Washington Post highlights this quote: \"I strongly believe that a small Jewish clique which has contempt for the mass of Jewish people worked with non-Jews to create the First World War, the Russian Revolution, and the Second World War.\" A Times rep says the column is a \"portrait of a public person through the lens of books; it is not a list of recommendations from our editors,\" who might \"dislike, disdain or even abhor\" the books mentioned, per the Guardian.

Officials at Alipore zoo are faced with a rather strange situation where one of their young male tigers is showing little or no interest in mating despite several not-so-subtle hints dropped by his female partner. No amount of aphrodisiac or libido stimulant has been successful in making him, er, rise to the occasion. Vishal and Rupa are the young white tiger couple in this much-anticipated captive breeding project. Alipore zoo has five tigresses and only three tigers. Vishal and Rupa, aged 10 and eight, were selected for their youth and vigour after the State Zoo Authority gave permission to resume captive breeding last year. But Vishal's performance \u2014 or the lack of it \u2014 has come as a major downer. \"We chose Vishal because he is the youngest and physically the most well-built among the male tigers. But we cannot understand what happens to him when he sees Rupa. He runs away with his tail between his legs,\" said Dayanarayan Banerjee, senior veterinary officer at the zoo. Medical officers and zoo keepers who have been closely monitoring the behaviour of the tiger and the tigress, said that when Rupa enters her oestrus cycle \u2014 a period of \"heat\" when she is sexually receptive and makes advances \u2014 Vishal shows zero interest. \"Once Rupa enters her oestrus cycle, she makes mating calls and tries to get close to Vishal. She scratches his back with her nails, tries to make physical contact and even chases him. But Vishal runs in the opposite direction,\" said Banerjee. After noticing his indifference, medical officers administered vitamins A and E last year to enhance Vishal's sexual appetite. When that did not get his blood thumping, the doctors administered a libido enhancer but even that did not lift Vishal's mood. \"None of it worked. Vishal kept snubbing Rupa's advances,\" said a zoo official. Perplexed, zoo authorities consulted experienced veterinary officers and specialists who attributed his demeanour to shyness due to captivity and not necessarily to lack of virility. \"Vishal has grown up in captivity due to which he has never interacted with the opposite sex earlier. He is shy and often unable to understand the biological signals his body is giving him,\" said a big cat specialist in the forest and wildlife department. The breeding of tigers in the zoo is very important for several reasons, say veterinary officers. \"Mating is a biological need of any living being and it is required to stay healthy. Second, the big cats in the zoo are not getting any younger. If we want a younger generation of tigers here in the years to come, we have to work on it right now,\" said Banerjee. The last time a tiger cub was bred in the zoo was more than a decade ago. Though several big cats were young at that time and ready to procreate, senior officials in the wildlife department were not willing to take any risk lest the tigers injure each other during the mating. When some officials have taken the initiative now, the age and the attitude of the tigers does not permit that. \"Tigers can be ferocious during mating. They may harm their partner if they get over excited or angry about something. Most of the directors over the last decade did not want to take any risk and kept postponing the mating process,\" said a senior official in the department. The breeding of tigers has become a challenge for zoo officials who have otherwise achieved major successes with giraffes, zebras, macaws and barking deer. \"We have a good mix of these animals where the young ones are regularly spawning. In case of lions and tigers we do not have the same advantage because most of them are past their prime,\" said Kanai Lal Ghosh, director of Alipore zoo. The zoo authorities aren't about to give up on Vishal yet \u2014 maybe a much younger tigress will get his mojo working. Officials are toying with the idea of setting up Vishal with the much nubile Rani. \"She is young and full of vigour. We are hoping she will succeed in enticing Vishal,\" said a veterinary officer. The question is will Vishal rise to the occasion this time? \n \n",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Male tigers are a lot like human men when it comes to sex. They're shy and awkward about their bodies if they haven't spent a lot of time around female tigers. They take libido enhancers when they get older. And, if a partner their own age isn't doing it for them, they consider trading them in for a younger, prettier tiger. BBC News reports India's Alipore zoo is having a difficult time getting its 10-year-old white tiger Vishal to mate. The zoo has tried vitamins and even de-worming him; nothing seems to be working. Experts are blaming the fact that Vishal was born in captivity, meaning he doesn't have much experience with females and might not understand the biological signals his body is sending, according to the Times of India. Plus, Vishal is at the outer limits of breeding age for tigers. This is apparently frustrating to Rupa, a female white tiger the zoo has assigned to breed with Vishal. While in heat, Rupa will chase, touch, and scratch Vishal, but he \"runs away with his tail between his legs,\" a veterinary consultant tells the Times. Zoo staff have been trying to mate the two tigers for six months, and it's important they succeed because the zoo's tiger population is getting older and hasn't had a birth in more than a decade. Now, staff are considering trying Vishal out with a much younger Bengal tiger named Rani, who is described as having \"a very beautiful face,\" the BBC reports. Ouch, Rupa."

        "Document": "A pill that helps people cut down on alcohol will be available to people who drink at least half a bottle of wine or three pints a night from today. Experts say the drug reduces the urge to drink and can be prescribed alongside counselling support. \n \n The National Institute for Health and Care Excellence (Nice) has published formal guidance recommending nalmefene, following draft guidance released in October, which means that patients have the right to request the drug if they meet certain requirements. \n \n Nalmefene, also called Selincro, is suitable for anyone who regularly drinks high amounts of alcohol, which is defined by the World Health Organisation as 7.5 units a day for men and five units a day for women. It helps patients gradually cut back on their alcohol intake and is therefore not suitable for anyone with a severe alcohol problem who needs to stop immediately. The pill costs \u00a33, can be taken up to once a day, and is designed to be used whenever the patient wants to stave off the desire to drink. \n \n Lyndsey Dudley, a spokeswoman for Nice, said the drug would be suitable for people who \u201cprobably don\u2019t even recognise themselves as an alcoholic\u201d. \n \n She said: \u201cIt is much like a patch that you might wear to give up smoking, to support you to cut down on your alcohol intake. Some days you might feel stronger than others.\u201d \n \n More than two million Britons are believed to be mildly dependent on alcohol. Thirty-five thousand people are expected to be given nalmefene as part of treatment for alcohol dependency in the first year. However, the actual figure might prove to be lower. Data released yesterday for Scotland, where nalmefene was approved for use in October last year, show that only 53 people were prescribed the drug in 2013/14. The 35,000 figure is based on the prediction that 58,000 people are expected to receive psychosocial intervention for mild alcohol dependency, of whom 60% will be given nalmefene. \n \n Dudley said the figure may change as \u201cpeople might not want to go down the medication route straight away\u201d. \n \n Information given by the drug\u2019s manufacturer Lundbeck identifies fictional examples of the sort of people eligible for nalmefene, including Sue, 39, who \u201clooks forward to a glass of wine after work when the kids go to bed but always finishes the bottle while cooking and eating with her husband, and opens a second bottle a few days each week\u201d. \n \n Professor Carole Longson, Nice\u2019s health technology evaluation centre director, said: \u201cMany people have a difficult relationship with alcohol even though they have a very stable lifestyle, maintain jobs and a social life and would not automatically assume they have a problem. But regularly drinking over the recommended daily amount of alcohol can seriously damage your health. \n \n \u201cThose who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services and taking part in therapy programmes. We are pleased to be able to recommend the use of namelfene to support people further in their efforts to fight alcohol dependence. \n \n \u201cWhen used alongside psychosocial support nalmefene is clinically and cost effective for the NHS compared with psychosocial support alone.\u201d \n \n Professor Jonathan Chick, a medical adviser for Drinkaware, said: \u201cTwo glasses of wine per day is not by any definition \u2018mild alcoholism\u2019. Nalmefene is for people who are concerned about their drinking, have tried to cut down, have been given brief advice/counselling by their doctor and are still regularly drinking more than low-risk levels. \n \n \u201cThe risks start at 14 units per week for women and 21 for men, but patients who will be prescribed nalmefene will be drinking higher amounts than that, and will have provoked changes in their brain patterns which have led to difficulty controlling their drinking.\u201d ||||| Middle-class drinkers in Britain who enjoy having more than three glasses of wine a night, will be given a pill to reduce their dependency on alcohol. \n \n The National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence has approved the use of Nalmefene, also called Selincro, to curb men and women drinking more than the required 7.5 units and 5 units a day limit. \n \n The institute said the drug has been approved for use alongside counselling support for people, who want to reduce their alcohol intake by up to 1.8 units a day. \n \n Nalmefene is available from today and costs \u00a342.42 for a 14-tablet pack, or about \u00a33 a day. Around 35,000 people are expected to be given Nalmefene in the first year. \n \n Professor Carole Longson, director from NICE Health Technology Evaluation Centre, said: \"Many people have a difficult relationship with alcohol even though they have a very stable lifestyle, maintain jobs and a social life and would not automatically assume they have a problem.

        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Those Brits who want to cut down on their alcohol intake\u2014and can spare about $5 a day\u2014now have access to a pill to reduce their craving. UK officials have approved the drug nalmefene for use along with counseling to help reduce alcohol dependency, the International Business Times reports. The official approval means people who fit the right profile can request the prescription drug. \"Those who could be prescribed nalmefene have already taken the first big steps by visiting their doctor, engaging with support services, and taking part in therapy programs,\" says a researcher. Nalmefene, which can be taken once a day, helps people feel less of an urge to drink, experts say. It's considered appropriate for many people drinking the equivalent of at least half a bottle of wine daily, the Guardian reports. Plenty of potential candidates to take the drug \"probably don\u2019t even recognize themselves as an alcoholic,\" says a health official, who compares it to a nicotine patch. But since nalmefene is intended to be used to gradually reduce alcohol intake, it's not a good solution for people who need to quit right away, the Guardian notes."

Cruz was the only member of the chamber not to vote. He did participate on a procedural vote earlier, opposing clearing the path for final confirmation. \n \n A spokeswoman for Cruz\u2019s presidential campaign said he missed the vote because he had to fly home to Texas for a fundraiser. \n \n \u201cHe voted against cloture which was the most important vote \u2014 once invoked, her confirmation was guaranteed,\u201d spokeswoman Catherine Frazier said. \u201cAs you know, Sen. Cruz led the charge to oppose her nomination, in interviews, op-eds and a floor speech today.

Add Interest \n \n Five Republican senators have already come out in opposition to the Senate bill, the Better Care Reconciliation Act, jeopardizing its passage. \n \n Critics on both sides of the aisle said the bill, which was drafted behind closed doors by a small group of Senate leaders and committee staffers, has been shrouded in secrecy. \n \n Trump told reporters Thursday that there will be \"a little negotiation, but it's going to be very good.\" \n \n Republicans 'not ready' to support the bill \n \n GOP Sens. Ted Cruz of Texas, Ron Johnson of Wisconsin, Mike Lee of Utah and Rand Paul of Kentucky released a joint statement saying, \"Currently, for a variety of reasons, we are not ready to vote for this bill, but we are open to negotiation and obtaining more information before it is brought to the floor.\" \n \n They added, \"There are provisions in this draft that represent an improvement to our current health care system, but it does not appear this draft as written will accomplish the most important promise that we made to Americans: to repeal Obamacare and lower their health care costs.\" \n \n In a separate statement, Paul said he'll oppose the bill \"in its current form, but I remain open to negotiations.\" \n \n \"The current bill does not repeal Obamacare. It does not keep our promises to the American people,\" he said. \n \n On Friday, Sen. Dean Heller, R-Nev., joined the group, saying at a press conference that \"this bill is not the answer, it's simply not the answer.\" \n \n \"In this form, I will not support it,\" said Heller. \n \n Sen. Susan Collins, R-Maine, told reporters Thursday she has \"not yet had the opportunity to read the text of the bill, and the details really matter.\" \n \n \"I see some positive features of this bill that are improvements over the House, and I see some negative features based on my first analysis,\" she said. \"I don't like the provision that eliminates federal funding for Planned Parenthood. It makes no sense to single out Planned Parenthood from all the Medicaid providers. There's already a ban against using federal funds for abortions, so there's absolutely no need for that.\" \n \n A vote from Collins, who has been willing to break from her party, would be key to ensuring the bill's passage. \n \n Senate Republicans can afford to lose only two of their members to pass the bill, assuming Democrats remain united in their opposition. \n \n Republicans acknowledge tough road ahead for bill \n \n As members left a meeting about the bill, many said they were encouraged by their first impressions of the text but were hesitant to say if it would clear the 50 vote threshold for passage. \n \n \"There's a lot to digest. It's very complicated,\" Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Pa., said as he left the gathering. \n \n Some Republicans said they liked how the Senate bill calculates the value of tax credits to help individuals pay for insurance. \n \n While the House bill linked the tax credits to age only, the Senate bill considers age, income and geographical area. \n \n \"A person making about $12,000 a year will have more access and a lower cost of health insurance. And that's a really good thing,\" said Sen. Tim Scott, R-S.C. \n \n But Sen. John Thune, R-S.D., a member of Senate leadership, acknowledged that the draft would not pass in its current form. \n \n \"Right now the challenge is, how do we get to 50?\" he said. \n \n Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell indicated that he wants to get a vote before the July 4 legislative recess. \n \n Democrats and ACA supporters unhappy \n \n The bill's release was met with significant opposition from Democrats and other supporters of the Affordable Care Act. \n \n Under current law, all insurance plans have to include, at a minimum, specified essential health benefits, including ambulance service, hospitalization, maternity care and prescription drug coverage. Under the Senate bill, states would be allowed to apply for waivers from those regulations and essentially scrap them to write their own rules. \n \n As the bill was being unveiled, a large demonstration formed outside McConnell's office, with people in wheelchairs staging a die-in and protesters chanting that no changes be made to Medicaid. Demonstrators were physically removed by Capitol Police officers. \n \n Congressional Democrats were also forceful in their condemnation. \n \n Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer slammed the Senate bill as \"every bit as bad\" as the American Health Care Act passed in the House. \n \n \"The president said the Senate bill needed heart. The way this bill cuts health care is heartless,\" Schumer said Thursday. \"The president said the house bill was mean. The Senate bill may be meaner.\" \n \n He continued, \"The Senate Republican health care bill is a wolf in sheep's clothing, only this wolf has even sharper teeth than the House bill.\" \n \n During her weekly press conference, House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi said it's important to stop the legislation, which she called \"a tax bill disguised as a health care bill.\" \n \n Top medical organizations call on the Senate to reject the bill \n \n So far, the Senate health care bill has not gotten any backing from top health or medical organizations. The American Public Health Association, the American Psychiatric Association and the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology released statements urging the Senate to reject the Better Care Reconciliation Act and expressed concerns over the closed-door negotiation process. \n \n \"The Senate proposal represents a significant move in the wrong direction, resulting in fewer people having access to insurance, fewer patient protections and less coverage for essential behavioral health care,\" American Psychiatric Association's CEO and medical director, Saul Levin, said in a statement. \n \n The American Public Health Association attacked the bill's closed-door shaping as \"legislative malpractice.\" \n \n The American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology said, \"Despite numerous efforts to collaborate and provide input throughout this process, women's health expertise was rejected.

It would rework the individual market so that enrollees get less financial help to purchase less generous health insurance with higher deductibles. \n \n Here is how the Senate bill works: \n \n The Senate bill begins to phase out the Medicaid expansion in 2021 \u2014 and cuts the rest of the program \u2019s budget too.

This program has provided coverage to more Americans than the private marketplaces It would also cut the rest of the public insurance program.

The Senate bill provides smaller subsidies for less generous health insurance plans with higher deductibles. The Affordable Care Act provides government help to anyone who earns less than 400 percent of the federal poverty line ($47,550 for an individual or $97,200 for a family of four). The people who earn the least get the most help. The Senate bill would make those subsidies much smaller for many people, and only provide the money to those earning less than 350 percent of the poverty line ($41,580 for individuals and $85,050 for a family of four). The Senate bill will tether the size of its tax credits to what it takes to purchase a skimpier health insurance plan than the type of plans Affordable Care Act subsidies were meant to buy. Essentially, these tax credits buy less health insurance. \n \n The Affordable Care Act provides government help to anyone who earns less than 400 percent of the federal poverty line ($47,550 for an individual or $97,200 for a family of four).

The bill gets rid of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s unpopular requirement that nearly all Americans carry health coverage or pay a fine.

Experts expect this would result in low-income Americans getting less medical care and having more unintended pregnancies, as access to contraceptives would decline. All in all, the replacement plan benefits people who are healthy and high-income, and disadvantages those who are sicker and lower-income. The replacement plan would make several changes to what health insurers can charge enrollees who purchase insurance on the individual market, as well as changing what benefits their plans must cover. In aggregate, these changes could be advantageous to younger and healthier enrollees who want skimpier (and cheaper) benefit packages. But they could be costly for older and sicker Obamacare enrollees who rely on the law\u2019s current requirements, and would be asked to pay more for less generous coverage. \n \n The Senate bill will end Medicaid expansion in 2021 \u2014 and cut the rest of the program too \n \n One of the main ways Obamacare increased insurance coverage was by expanding the Medicaid program to cover millions more low-income Americans. Prior to the health law, the entitlement was restricted to specific groups of low-income Americans (pregnant women, for example, and the blind and disabled). \n \n Obamacare opened up the program to anyone below 138 percent of the poverty line (about $15,000 for an individual) in the 31 states (plus the District of Columbia) that opted to participate. \n \n The Medicaid expansion gave states generous funding to cover this particular population. Typically, the federal government picks up about half the cost of the Medicaid program and states cover the rest. \n \n For Medicaid expansion, however, the federal government currently pays 95 percent of the costs \u2014 an especially good deal for states meant to assuage their budget concerns during the original Obamacare debate. \n \n The Senate bill would begin ratcheting down that Medicaid expansion funding in 2021. By 2024, states would get that same match rate they typically get to cover other populations. In 2021, for example, the match rate would fall to 90 percent, then decline in steps to 75 percent by 2023. \n \n The Congressional Budget Office has projected in a separate analysis that this policy change would mean no additional states expand Medicaid \u2014 and that some current expansion states would drop out of the program, resulting in millions losing coverage. \n \n \u201cCBO anticipates some states that have already expanded their Medicaid programs would no longer offer that coverage,\u201d the agency wrote in its analysis of the House bill, which makes a similar change. \n \n The Senate bill would cut the rest of the Medicaid program too \n \n There are significant changes to Medicaid in the Senate bill outside of the expansion too. This bill would convert Medicaid to a \u201cper capita cap\u201d system, where states would get a lump sum from the federal government for each enrollee. Or states would have the opportunity of a block grant \u2014 a sum of money untethered from the number of people involved. \n \n This is very different from current Medicaid funding. Right now the federal government has an open-ended commitment to paying all of a Medicaid enrollee\u2019s bills, regardless of how high they go. \n \n The Senate bill would set different amounts for different groups of people. It envisions, for example, likely higher payments to cover Medicaid enrollees who are disabled (and tend to have higher costs) than Medicaid enrollees who are kids (generally healthy with lower costs). \n \n The rate at which these payments grow is also important. The Senate bill would have the funding growth tethered to the Medical Consumer Price Index plus 1 percentage point through 2025, and then switch to the urban Consumer Price Index. Analysis of this type of proposal suggests this change would amount to funding cuts for Medicaid, as the program\u2019s spending typically goes up faster than these growth rates. \n \n We do not know exactly how much this bill would cut the Medicaid program because we are still waiting on an analysis from the CBO, which is expected to be released early next week. \n \n vox-mark VoxCare Vox's email explaining the biggest news in health care, edited by Sarah Kliff Subscribe By signing up, you agree to our Privacy Policy and European users agree to the data transfer policy. For more newsletters, check out our newsletters page \n \n The Senate bill would cut the subsidies for people on the individual market \n \n The Affordable Care Act provides financial help to low- and middle-income Americans who purchase their own health coverage. It provides subsidies to people who earn less than 400 percent of the federal poverty line ($47,550 for an individual or $97,200 for a family of four) and gives the most generous help to people who earn the least. \n \n For example: People who earn $17,000 are only expected to spend 3 percent of their income on premiums for a midlevel insurance plan \u2014 the government will kick in the rest. People who earn $40,000, however, are expected to spend 9.66 percent of their income on those monthly payments. \n \n The Senate bill would overhaul these tax credits. It would make fewer people eligible for the help, limiting the subsidies to people who earn less than 350 percent of the poverty line ($41,580 for individuals and $85,050 for a family of four). \n \n It would also allow people who earn less than the poverty line to qualify for tax credits; the Affordable Care Act makes those people ineligible for the subsidies because they were expected to receive coverage through the Medicaid expansion. \n \n This became problematic, however, when the Supreme Court ruled that the Medicaid expansion had to be optional and 19 states decided not to adopt it. So this change would be an improvement for low-income Americans who live in places like Texas and Florida, which did not expand the program. They currently have access to no subsidies under the Affordable Care Act. \n \n It would also change the definition of what counts as \u201caffordable\u201d health insurance to amount for a greater chunk of Obamacare enrollees\u2019 income. Right now the Affordable Care Act counts health insurance as \u201caffordable\u201d if it costs less than 9.7 percent of an individual\u2019s income (and a lower amount for lower-income Americans). You can see the table here: \n \n The Senate bill would raise the amount individuals are expected to kick into their health plans for people who are low to middle income. A 60-year-old who earns $35,640 (300 percent of the poverty line) would be expected to spend 16.2 percent of her income ($5,773) before she gets any help from the government. You can see the chart that spells this out here: \n \n Under the Affordable Care Act, she would only be expected to spend $3,442. \n \n The Senate would subsidize less generous insurance. Under the health care law, the size of the tax credit is tethered to how much it costs to buy a midlevel health plan. The Affordable Care Act defines \u201cmidlevel\u201d as a plan that, on average, covers 70 percent of enrollees\u2019 costs. In insurance terms, this number is known as the \u201cactuarial value,\u201d and it\u2019s used to give a sense of how much the typical enrollee pays out of pocket for coverage. \n \n The Senate bill would tether its tax credits to less generous health insurance. Specifically, it would provide subsidies that make a plan with a 58 percent actuarial value (meaning, on average, it covers 58 percent of enrollees\u2019 costs) affordable. \n \n This means that the plans people could afford under the Senate bill would likely have more copays and higher deductibles as a way to bump up the amount enrollees have to chip in for their own coverage. Someone who has earnings right around the poverty line (about $12,000) would still be expected to spend 2 percent of her income on premiums. But in return, she\u2019d get a health plan that covers less than what she gets under the Affordable Care Act. \n \n The Senate bill would also bar Americans from using their tax credits to purchase a health plan that covers abortion. This requirement would take effect immediately, while other changes would not phase in until 2020. \n \n The Senate bill allows states to opt-out of big Obamacare provisions, like the requirement to cover essential health benefits, through a re-vamped waiver process \n \n The Senate bill overhauls a section of the Affordable Care Act that allows states to experiment with different ways to provide health insurance coverage. Under current law, states are allowed to propose different ways to deliver health insurance so long as the new plans \u201cprovide coverage that is at least as comprehensive as the coverage\u201d defined under the ACA\u201d and \u201ccover at least a comparable number of residents.\u201d In other words: as long as states can cover the same number of people with a similar plan, they\u2019re allowed to experiment with things such as single-payer health care. \n \n The Senate bill would allow states to seek waiver from key Obamacare requirements, things like the essential health benefits package, which requires health plans to cover key services like maternity care and prescription drugs. But the Senate bill would not require these new plans to cover as many people or provide comparable plans. It eliminates those requirements, and says states can get waivers as long as they don\u2019t increase the deficit. \n \n You can see the language that gets removed in this helpful tweet: \n \n So this bill aims to totally gut 1332 coverage protections. pic.twitter.com/jcTgDGoEpH \u2014 Adrianna McIntyre (@onceuponA) June 22, 2017 \n \n Under these requirements, a state could ask for a waiver to allow insurers to longer cover things like maternity care or mental health services \u2014 two things that individual plans often left out before the Affordable Care Act mandates. They would not be bound by the current Affordable Care Act requirement that coverage under these waivers be just as generous as the standard plans. \n \n The Senate bill eliminates the individual mandate \u2014 and replaces it with a six-month waiting period to penalize the uninsured \n \n One of the Affordable Care Act\u2019s least popular provisions was the requirement that nearly all Americans carry health insurance coverage or pay a fine. The reason this mandate existed was to convince healthy people to buy health insurance, which would hold down premiums for everyone else. \n \n The Senate would eliminate the individual mandate by setting the penalty for not carrying health insurance to zero dollars. They can\u2019t completely wipe it off the books due to the complex rules of the budget reconciliation process, but this would have the same effect. \n \n The Senate bill replaces the individual mandate with a six-month waiting period for those who fail to maintain continuous health insurance coverage. Specifically, this means that those with a break in coverage longer than 63 days would have to wait at least six months from the date they file an application for health coverage to enroll in a plan. This is on top of the health care law\u2019s open enrollment periods, which would still exist under the Senate plan. \n \n The six-month waiting period fills a big policy gap in the first draft of the Better Care Reconciliation Act, which required health plans to accept all patients \u2014 but didn\u2019t require all Americans to purchase coverage, as the Affordable Care Act does. Experts expected that this would cause a death spiral, where only the sickest patients purchase coverage and premiums skyrocket. \n \n The new six-month waiting period aims to fix that problem. It is meant to nudge healthy people into purchasing coverage because they may fear the consequences of getting locked out of the market down the road. \n \n The Senate bill repeals a long list of Obamacare taxes \n \n The Senate bill will eliminate many of the taxes that financed the Affordable Care Act\u2019s insurance expansion. It includes the repeal of: \n \n A tax on investment income \n \n A tax on the wealthy to finance the Medicare program \n \n A tax on tanning salons \n \n A tax on the health insurance industry \n \n A tax on the medical device industry \n \n Many of these tax changes would, as my colleagues have previously written, disproportionately benefit high-income Americans. \n \n \u201cThe typical American, in short, isn\u2019t going to see any money from these tax cuts,\u201d Matt Yglesias has written. \u201cBut when you take all that money out of the system, something has to give. And in the case of the various iterations of Affordable Care Act repeal, the thing that gives is the quality of health insurance provided to Americans with below-average incomes or above-average health needs.\u201d \n \n Join the conversation \n \n Are you an Obamacare enrollee interested in what happens next?

I\u2019ve said, \u2018Add some money to it,'\u201d Trump told a crowd in Iowa Wednesday night. \n \n Now that the Senate\u2019s plan is out, does it pass the White House test? Does it have more heart? \n \n The short answer: a little. But it\u2019s probably still mean. \n \n If you\u2019ve got preexisting conditions or rely on Obamacare\u2019s health insurance subsidies, the Senate version of the legislation is certainly \u201cnicer\u201d\u2014though still not as \u201cnice\u201d as Obamacare itself. On Medicaid, under the expansion? You\u2019re ever so slightly better off than you would be under the House version of the bill, at least for a few years. \n \n And if you\u2019re one of the 59 million Americans who rely on traditional Medicaid, this legislation is actually significantly meaner. \n \n The relative \u201cmeanness\u201d of the legislation could still change\u2014in either direction. Lawmakers said Thursday Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is likely to make further changes as he works to convince reluctant members of his conference to back the plan ahead of an anticipated vote next Thursday. McConnell can spare just two Republican votes and still pass the measure, since no Democrat is expected to support it. \n \n For now, several Senate Republicans are still evaluating whether the bill has gotten any nicer \u2014 and are quick to say it could yet change. Even the Senate health chairman, Lamar Alexander of Tennessee, demurred on the question after a Thursday briefing on the bill, saying he needed to read it more closely. \n \n We took a look at the four of the major proposals from the Senate and whether they represent a softening of the House version of the legislation\u2014or something meaner. \n \n Changes to the health law\u2019s subsidies \n \n Senate Republicans have promised for months that they would make the tax credits included in the House\u2019s health care measure more generous\u2014and they have. The tax credits, like those in Obamacare, are aimed at helping people who don\u2019t get health insurance through their job or a government program like Medicare or Medicaid afford a plan. \n \n Obamacare\u2019s tax credits were largely aimed at helping some of the poorest and oldest people in that category, which often meant that younger or wealthier people didn\u2019t get as much financial help. House Republicans changed the way the subsidies are structured, to make more money available to younger and wealthier Americans, at the expense of the opposite group. They also included less money for the subsidies overall. \n \n The Senate tempered that plan, returning to a subsidy structure nearly identical to the one laid out in Obamacare, though less generous. Beginning in 2020, the Senate version of the subsidies will focus more of the help on low-income people\u2014including some of the people that Obamacare assumed would rely on Medicaid, in expansion states. People earning an annual salary of up to $47,550 this year could qualify for help under Obamacare; under the Senate plan that number drops to $41,580. For a family of four, Obamacare would have helped those earning up to $97,200; the Senate limits that amount to $85,050 this year. \n \n There\u2019s definitely more \u201cheart\u201d behind that move, especially for poorer or older Americans, or for those living in places with especially high health care costs. But the financial help remains less generous than the help available under current law. \n \n Changes for people with preexisting conditions \n \n An extremely controversial, last-minute amendment to the House-passed health care measure would have let states opt out of some of Obamacare\u2019s most onerous health insurance requirements\u2014including its rule that insurers charge everyone the same price for health insurance whether or not they suffer from a preexisting health condition. At least in some places, it could have returned some Americans to a time when insurers could jack up your insurance rates if they found out you were sick. \n \n The Senate draft won\u2019t let states waive that requirement\u2014a much \u201cnicer\u201d measure for anyone with preexisting conditions. \n \n But it will let states waive a whole host of other protections for Americans who don\u2019t get their insurance through their job or a government program\u2014like provisions that require insurance plans to cover certain benefits like care for people with autism or for new moms. People with preexisting conditions, then, might be able to get coverage\u2014but depending on where they live, it might not actually cover services they need. \n \n Whether it\u2019s more or less nice, then, is up in the air\u2014and probably depends on where you live. \n \n Changes to Medicaid expansion \n \n For states that expanded Medicaid, the Senate version of the package may be nicer than the House version\u2014but only temporarily. Obamacare encouraged states to expand their Medicaid programs to adults with slightly higher annual incomes with an enticing offer of substantial federal funding. The House measure would essentially have cut off that extra funding abruptly in 2020. \n \n The Senate draft instead begins winding down that extra funding in 2021, phasing it out more gradually over the following three years\u2014at least in states that don\u2019t end it sooner. \n \n That\u2019s a \u201cnicer\u201d path for the next few years, but, ultimately, it\u2019s just as mean as before. \n \n Changes to Medicaid \n \n The \u201cmeanest\u201d change to the Senate draft concerns the traditional Medicaid program, which provides health insurance for millions of low-income Americans. The House-passed package included huge, sweeping cuts to the federal funding for the program, worth a whopping $834 billion over the next 10 years. A nonpartisan analysis of the cuts found it would nix Medicaid coverage for some 14 million Americans. \n \n Far from mitigating those cuts, the Senate version actually ramps them up more quickly, beginning in 2025. Researchers at the Urban Institute suggest the change would cut as much as an extra $63.7 billion from Medicaid in the year 2028 alone. That makes the draft decidedly \u201cmean\u201d for anyone relying on the program. \n \n \u201cStates will have to fill this shortfall by raising taxes, cutting enrollment, reducing benefits, or reducing provider reimbursement\u2014all of which are difficult choices,\u201d Matthew Buettgens, a senior research associate at the Urban Institute, wrote. \n \n Changes in funding for mental health and opioid addiction \n \n The Senate came close to tempering one of the biggest criticisms levied against the White House and its support for the House-passed American Health Care Act: that it would be devastating to thousands in need of treatment for substance abuse, especially opioids. \n \n The package passed by the House didn\u2019t do much to address the opioid crisis, but it would put about $15 billion in funding toward expanding access to mental health services. That\u2019s gone in the Senate version. \n \n But what\u2019s decidedly \u201cmean\u201d about this latest draft is a policy that\u2019s absent from the measure. Two Republican senators from heavily impacted states\u2014Rob Portman of Ohio and Shelley Moore Capito of West Virginia\u2014pushed Senate leaders to include a staggering $4.5 billion for each of the next 10 years in funding to help people suffering from opioid addictions. \n \n Instead, the package includes a $2 billion appropriation for 2018 alone\u2014$43 billion less than the lawmakers had requested. \n \n In the end, the Senate was never going to be able to deliver a measure that was a whole lot nicer, despite Trump\u2019s pleas. \n \n There\u2019s a simple reason for that: making the package more generous requires more spending, and the congressional process Republicans are using limits how much they can spend. That process, reconciliation, requires their version of the legislation to generate as much budgetary savings as the House version did. That means their package can\u2019t suddenly include tax credits that are 10 times more generous than the House bill, unless they cut other programs by trillions of dollars. \n \n \u201cIt shows the bind Senate Republicans are in. The bill has to have the same amount of deficit reduction,\u201d said Edwin Park, vice president for public policy at the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities, which has criticized the Republican plan. \u201cUnless they\u2019re changing the basic structure, you end up with the same results.\u201d \n \n Put simply, they\u2019re boxed in. There\u2019s no easy way to \u201cadd some money to it,\u201d as Trump suggested. \n \n Since the House plan was \u201cmean,\u201d the Senate plan is, too. \n \n Lev Facher contributed reporting. \n \n Republished with permission from STAT.

First, they are part of a broader group of Republican senators who have been complaining about the GOP\u2019s repeal-Obamacare process since the start of the year. Lee and Paul, along with Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, have generally worried that the Obamacare repeal may still leave too much of the law in place. \u201cNo Obamacare lite,\u201d Paul wrote in February. \n \n On the other ideological end, Collins and Murkowski \u2014 along with Sens. Bill Cassidy (Louisiana), Shelley Moore Capito (West Virginia), Cory Gardner (Colorado), Dean Heller (Nevada) and Rob Portman (Ohio) \u2014 have at times pushed back against repealing too much of Obamacare, worrying that the Republicans may not be doing enough to protect people on Medicaid or those with pre-existing conditions. \n \n SENATOR STATE EXPANDED MEDICAID TRUMP MARGIN TRUMP SCORE Susan Collins -3 86.0% Rand Paul \u2713 +30 87.8 Lisa Murkowski \u2713 +15 92.9 Dean Heller \u2713 -2 93.0 Ted Cruz +9 95.3 Cory Gardner \u2713 -5 95.3 Mike Lee +18 95.3 Rob Portman \u2713 +8 95.3 Shelley Moore Capito \u2713 +42 97.6 Bill Cassidy \u2713 +20 97.7 Senators who have expressed doubts about the Obamacare repeal Trump score measures how often members of Congress vote with Trump\u2019s position on major legislation. Source: Kaiser Family Foundation \n \n So any of these members could provide the three votes that would kill this bill. I chose those four because I would argue they would have the clearest rationales to stop an Obamacare repeal and be able to explain that vote to their Republican constituents. Based on our \u201cTrump Score,\u201d Collins and Murkowski are among the five Senate Republicans who most vote against Trump\u2019s positions on major legislation. Collins has a reputation as a more moderate Republican and is in a state that Hillary Clinton carried in 2016. In 2010, Murkowski was defeated by a more conservative Republican in Alaska\u2019s GOP primary, but then ran in the general election and won as a write-in candidate. \n \n Also, both of these senators, unlike many of the others in the group of more moderate Republicans, have specifically complained about a provision in the bill that would effectively bar, for one year, Medicaid recipients from getting coverage at Planned Parenthood clinics. Republicans object to Planned Parenthood because it offers abortion services. (There is an existing ban on the use of federal funds to pay for abortions.) \n \n I\u2019m not saying other moderates won\u2019t oppose this legislation. But if a coalition of more moderate members rises up to oppose this bill, it is very likely to include Collins and Murkowski. \n \n On the conservative end, Cruz has been hinting that he wants to use this bill to show fellow Republicans that he can be a team player, working with the party instead of clashing with it as he did for much of 2013 and 2014. It\u2019s hard to see him leading a lonely charge against this legislation. \n \n In contrast, Paul in particular has been scathing. Speaking to reporters this week, before the bill\u2019s official release, he called what he had seen of the Senate\u2019s work on Obamacare repeal \u201cweak-kneed.\u201d Lee has also been a regular critic of the Senate\u2019s bill, even before its release. And the Senate bill, like Obamacare, will use a system of tax credits that vary based on income, which makes it easier for poorer people to buy insurance. The House bill gave tax credits to people to purchase insurance based on age. That change could embolden both Paul and Lee further. \n \n What else might affect these senators\u2019 decisions and potentially those of their colleagues? First, how will outside groups react? Generally, groups representing patients, such as AARP, and medical groups, like the American College of Physicians, have been wary of this legislation. Will they try to aggressively mobilize their members against it? Perhaps more importantly, how will major conservative groups view the bill? One important factor in the initial failure of the House version of Obamacare repeal was that conservative groups felt it did not repeal enough of Obamacare. \n \n Indeed, Philip Rocco, a political scientist at the Marquette University who co-wrote a book called \u201cObamacare Wars\u201d that details the fights over the law in states from essentially the moment it passed, said it was particularly important to watch the moves of conservative groups such as Americans for Prosperity and Heritage Action in the context of Lee and Paul. He argued that if key parts of the conservative movement said this bill is enough of an Obamacare repeal, it will be hard for Lee and Paul to oppose it. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think it\u2019s right to think of them as lone wolves,\u201d Rocco said. \n \n Second, how will Republican House members, particularly the hard-to-please Freedom Caucus, view this legislation? Freedom Caucus members have been in contact with the Senate about the legislation, Alyssa Farah, the group\u2019s spokesperson, told me. That said, it\u2019s not clear if they have signed off on the final product. Republican senators will be leery of backing a bill that the Freedom Caucus does not want, since that means this legislation may not be able to pass the House. \n \n Third, don\u2019t forget the Congressional Budget Office. The CBO is expected to release its \u201cscore\u201d of the bill next week. That will be a heavily covered news event. But it is unlikely to be very surprising, since this legislation is not radically different from the two House different bills that the House had evaluated by the CBO. Last month, Collins blasted the House version of this legislation, specifically citing numbers from the CBO report on it. \n \n I have not included President Trump\u2019s reaction as something to watch, because I\u2019m not convinced he will be a major factor. His closed-door comments about the bill the House passed being \u201cmean\u201d were probably not helpful to Republicans, but it\u2019s hard to see him publicly blasting the Senate bill or ultimately vetoing whatever legislation comes through Congress. I will acknowledge that the president\u2019s behavior is unpredictable and that a strong denunciation of a Republican health care bill by a Republican president might shift things. \n \n We don\u2019t know where this process is headed. Senate Republicans say there could be a vote next week, but it could be put off if senators demand changes. A broad coalition of members could come to McConnell and say that they can\u2019t back this bill, as what happened to the initial version. The House is still a wild card. \n \n But this legislation will only be truly dead if it\u2019s clear that at least three Senate Republicans are prepared to vote against it \u2014 or they actually do. And that gives a little power to this group of four senators. ||||| CLOSE Senate Republicans have unveiled their latest health care legislation, which aims to repeal and replace Obamacare. As expected, both side voiced bold and passionate reactions to the measure. USA TODAY \n \n Minority Leader Chuck Schumer holds a news conference on the reaction of Senate Democratic leadership to the release of the draft of the GOP health care plan on June 22, 2017. (Photo: Michael Reynolds, European Pressphoto Agency) \n \n WASHINGTON \u2014 After days of protesting GOP \u201csecrecy\u201d in crafting their health care bill, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer of New York and other Democratic leaders began a strategy on Thursday of trying to slow down consideration of the proposal. \n \n Their first steps were to get Republicans on record objecting calls for transparency. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky turned down their requests for any changes to the House-passed Obamacare replacement to be public for 72 hours and be subject to a Congressional Budget Office analysis \u2014 though CBO is promising to release an analysis next week. \n \n Ultimately, there\u2019s not much Democrats can do to block the bill\u2019s passage if enough Republicans fall in line, but they can make the process onerous. Democrats have been calling on the American public to weigh in against \u201cTrumpcare.\u201d \n \n \u201cEvery American should be asking their Republican senators one simple question this weekend: Why do the wealthy deserve a tax cut more than we deserve health care?\u201d Schumer said. \n \n Republicans are using a budget procedure to pass the bill with a simple majority of 51 votes, rather than the 60 votes typically needed for legislation. \n \n The rules allow Democrats \u2014 and Republicans \u2014 to offer unlimited amendments on the Senate floor next week, when it is expected to come up for a vote. But Democrats are effectively blocked from filibustering the bill. \n \n The bigger obstacle for Republicans may be within their own party, with some conservatives saying the bill doesn't go far enough in repealing the Affordable Care Act and one moderate, Sen.

Democrats are united against it, meaning that McConnell can afford to lose only two GOP votes. \n \n If the Senate passes its version, the House and Senate would have to settle on compromise legislation before it can be signed by President Trump. \n \n Though Trump celebrated passage of the House version of the health care bill in May, he has since called it \u201cmean\u201d and said the Senate plan should have more \u201cheart.\u201d The House-passed health care bill, called the American Health Care Act, would lead to 23 million fewer people having health insurance by 2026, according to the Congressional Budget Office. \n \n Read more: \n \n During a news conference, Schumer edited a \u201cMean\u201d poster with a marker to make it say \u201cMeaner.\u201d \n \n He said the Senate bill would raise health care costs for middle-class and working-class families, kick millions off Medicaid, abandon people with pre-existing conditions and defund Planned Parenthood, making it harder for millions of women to obtain health care. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s every bit as bad as the House bill, in some ways even worse,\u201d he said. \n \n Regardless the outcome, there\u2019s not much of a downside for Democratic senators to be seen by their base as fighting the bill as robustly as possible.

        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Senate Republicans on Thursday finally unveiled their answer to the House bill to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, and Vox has an explainer of what's in it. Some major sticking points: The Better Care Reconciliation Act will ask poor and middle-class Americans to pay more for less coverage, and Medicaid would be cut after expansions are rolled back. Medicaid patients would be unable to get treatment at Planned Parenthood, which would be defunded for a year. The bill also includes a tax break for the wealthy. Here's what else you need to know: First, Politico has the full text of the 142-page document Republicans are calling a \"discussion draft.\" Three Republican senators can defeat the bill by joining Democrats to vote against it. FiveThirtyEight reports the most likely candidates are Rand Paul and Mike Lee (who don't believe it goes far enough; Paul recently said he doesn't want \"ObamaCare lite\") and Susan Collins and Lisa Murkowski (who want more protections for Medicaid and pre-existing conditions). ABC News reports four Republican senators have already said they won't vote for the bill without more information and negotiation: Paul, Lee, Ron Johnson, and Ted Cruz. They released a joint statement saying the bill doesn't do enough to repeal ObamaCare. The bill's writing was cloaked in such secrecy that the Week reports as of Thursday morning quite a few Republican senators still had not seen it; Murkowski, for example, told a reporter, \"I am not a reporter, and I am not a lobbyist, so I've seen nothing.\" President Trump had called the House bill \"mean\" and in need of \"more heart.\" So Scientific American takes a look to see if the Senate version fulfills that requirement. When asked by a reporter if the Senate bill had enough heart, Trump called it \"very good\" but in need of \"a little negotiation,\" CNN reports. According to People, police dragged protesters\u2014some of them in wheelchairs or wearing medical devices\u2014away from Mitch McConnell's office and arrested them. The protesters, members of a national disability rights group, say people with disabilities are threatened by the bill. Finally, USA Today reports Senate Democrats plan to fight the bill through procedural requests to slow down the process. They called for any changes to the House's bill to be made public for at least 72 hours and be subject to CBO analysis."

She also ordered the tablet-sized computer to beep every two minutes. \n \n She did all that without leaving her Manlius home. \n \n Armed with a computer application called MobileMe, Hootnick pursued the iPad she believed was stolen after she left it on an American Airlines plane in New York City. \n \n \u201cI just wanted to harass who ever took it,\u201d Hootnick said. \u201cI didn\u2019t want him to enjoy it if he was using it.\u201d \n \n Hootnick\u2019s story began when she took her iPad on a family vacation to the Turks and Caicos islands in the Caribbean. The family returned to the United States on April 1, landing at John F. Kennedy International Airport. \n \n Hootnick remembers using the iPad on the flight, and believes she may have set it down on the seat while gathering her things from the overhead compartment after the plane landed. \n \n In a taxi on the way to a hotel, Hootnick realized the device was missing. That night, she reported the iPad missing in a message left on the answering machine at the airline\u2019s lost and found department. She left another message in the morning. \n \n Then Hootnick remembered she had MobileMe, a computer application that uses global positioning satellites to track electronic devices like iPads. \n \n Using another computer, she found the iPad. It wasn\u2019t at the airport. It was in a house on Long Island, and by clicking on the address Hootnick could see the two-story house with the curving driveway on Google Earth. \n \n \u201cSuddenly, I knew it wasn\u2019t going to be in lost and found,\u201d she said. \n \n Hootnick contacted American Airlines and police at the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey. \u2019\u2019My iPad was taken and I know where it is,\u201d she told them. \n \n She continued to watch her iPad remotely while waiting for the police to act. \n \n \u201cI was frustrated after days of this.

I was watching it everyday, I was becoming a little obsessive,\u201d Hootnick said. \n \n Sitting at home at another computer, Hootnick watched remotely as her iPad traveled to the JFK parking lot. It sat there for two days. Then she watched it travel to the Los Angeles airport and back to JFK, to the San Francisco airport and back to JFK. \n \n With the device traveling that often, Hootnick suspected the iPad was being used by an airline employee. \n \n Using another application, she sent the computer a command to make an annoying \u201cbeeeep\u201d every two minutes and send messages saying she knew where the person lived and had called authorities. \n \n She traded emails with the airline notifying the company that she believed an employee had her iPad. A month later when no one acted, Hootnick emailed the airline that she was going to contact a consumer protection agency. \n \n The next day, a person from American Airlines corporate security called, asking for information. She had two more conversations with a police detective asked by American Airlines to look into the case. \n \n American Airlines won\u2019t comment on Hootnick\u2019s case because it\u2019s the subject of an ongoing investigation, said Ed Martelle, speaking for the airline. \n \n The company is not responsible for lost or stolen items, but does not condone theft, he said. \n \n The case now resides with the Port Authority, whose officials have not returned several calls from The Post-Standard. \n \n \n \n As for the iPad, Hootnick no longer knows where it is. When she replaced the device she turned off the wireless service to the old iPad, and that means she can no longer track it. \n \n The iPad is probably useless to the person who has it, Hootnick said. If anyone tries to buy wireless service for the device the serial number will pop up as it being reported stolen, Hootnick said. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s probably in the river,\u201d she said. \n \n",

Abdulmutallab, who faces life in prison if convicted, is to appear for the first time in federal court Friday.

Read more ||||| Anwar al-Awlaki has also been linked to the Fort Hood shootings The alleged US plane bomber met radical Muslim cleric Anwar al-Awlaki in Yemen, after being recruited in London, a senior Yemeni official has said. Last week US security official John Brennan said there were \"indications\" of direct contact between the two men. Mr Awlaki was linked to an attack by a US Army major on the Fort Hood base in November, in which 13 people died. Yemen's deputy prime minister also said bomb suspect Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab used explosives from Nigeria not Yemen. Mr Abdulmutallab was indicted by a US grand jury on six counts on Wednesday. ANWAR AL-AWLAKI Born 1971 in New Mexico Sermons in San Diego, California, attended by two of 9/11 hijackers Endorsed violence as religious duty Moved to Yemen in 2004 to live in ancestral home village Jailed in 2006 for alleged plot to kidnap US military attache Advised Fort Hood suspect Maj Nidal Malik Hasan by e-mail \n \n Profile: Anwar al-Awlaki Al-Qaeda's influence in Yemen Q&A: 'Jet bomber' case Charges against him include attempted murder of the 290 people aboard the plane and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction. Mr Abdulmutallab allegedly tried to detonate a bomb on Northwest flight 253 from Amsterdam to Detroit, but the plane landed safely after crew and passengers overpowered him. In a separate development, Yemeni Deputy Prime Minister Rashad al-Alimi said that five Germans including three children and a Briton kidnapped in Yemen six months ago were still alive. He said northern Shia rebels were co-operating with al-Qaeda over the kidnap. 'Not just a cleric' Mr Alimi told journalists that Mr Abdulmutallab \"joined al-Qaeda in London\". The suspected bomber studied at University College London (UCL) from September 2005 to June 2008 and was president of its Islamic society in 2006-07. Umar Farouk Abdulmutallab has been in custody since 25 December But UCL has said there is no evidence to suggest Mr Abdulmutallab was radicalised while he was there, and UK officials responding to the Yemeni statement said they still believed his recruitment occurred in Yemen in the months before the attack. Mr Alimi said the suspect met Mr Awlaki in the cleric's ancestral home province of Shabwa. Mr Awlaki, a radical American Muslim cleric of Yemeni descent, has been linked to other attacks, including that carried out by Maj Nidal Malik Hasan of the US Army at the Fort Hood base in Texas in November. \"Mr Awlaki is a problem. He's clearly a part of al-Qaeda in [the] Arabian Peninsula,\" Mr Brennan, who is US deputy national security adviser, told CNN last week. \"He's not just a cleric. He is in fact trying to instigate terrorism.\" Some reports say the cleric was killed just before the Christmas attack, in an airstrike on a suspected al-Qaeda base. However, friends and relatives say he was not harmed in the raid. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen in Sanaa says Yemen has been accused of soft-pedalling on al-Qaeda and is currently under pressure from its ally the US to produce results. There have been a number of shootouts recently, but the authorities have as yet been unable to capture one of their prime targets, Mohammed al-Hanouk. However, Mr Hanouk is a member of a prominent tribal family, our correspondent says, and this suggests that the government is prepared to push hard in directions it might be easier to leave alone. 'A certain shock' Confirmation of the meeting between the alleged bomber and the cleric comes as the White House plans to publish a declassified account of the Christmas Day plot. In an interview for USA Today newspaper, National Security Adviser Gen James Jones said people would feel \"a certain shock\" that clues about Mr Abdulmutallab's role were not acted on. President Barack Obama \"is legitimately and correctly alarmed that things that were available, bits of information that were available, patterns of behaviour that were available, were not acted on\", he said. Mr Obama is expected to address the nation about the incident later in the day and unveil new steps aimed at avoiding further terrorist attacks. \n \n \n \n Bookmark with: Delicious \n \n Digg \n \n reddit \n \n Facebook \n \n StumbleUpon What are these?

It\u2019s open to anyone with an undergrad degree, but if students want to take more courses they\u2019ll have to go through the normal admissions process. \u201cThere are all kinds of factors in the K-12 world that are really discouraging,\u201d the school\u2019s VP of marketing says. \u201cWe'd like (potential students) to understand what the realities are, whether you are committed to this profession ... and see if you have what it takes.\u201d The Groupon deal goes live today: It offers the $2,232 course for $950 and will run until tomorrow, or until 25 people sign up, according to Mashable. Once students complete the class, they'll have three of the 36 credits they need for a degree."

Locust, shortly after 8 a.m. and Holy Cross Catholic Church, 1327 N. Miranda, about a half hour later. The explosion at Holy Cross took place in a trash can just outside the entrance of the church as services for the 8 a.m. Mass were taking place. \n \n Robin Zielinski \u2014 Sun-News Holy Cross Catholic Church pastoral associate Elizabeth Behnke informs parishioners of ride arrangements and that their cars must be left at the church until the parking lot is searched on Sunday. \n \n Monsignor John Anderson had been in the part of the service where communion is passed. \n \n \"I was right in the middle of saying the words 'take and eat, this is my body' and there was a Pow! I mean, I knew it had to be more than a gunshot,\" he said. \"It didn't know if it was a shotgun blast, I didn't know what. But it was very loud and I just kept on saying the words.\" \n \n Ann Marie Sullivan, a college student and lifelong parishioner at Holy Cross, described it. \"It sounded like something had fallen off and shattered the glass in the back.\" \n \n At the end of the Lord's Prayer, the pastor sent a deacon to find out what had happened, and it was reported that a bomb had exploded in a trash can outside the front glass doors, shattering the thick glass. \n \n Advertisement \n \n \"I had just received communion and had gotten back to my chair when the police came up and said we need everyone to leave out the doors calmly,\" Sullivan said, saying police told parishioners. \"We have it under control but we need you to leave the building.\" \n \n Ten minutes later, and it could have been much worse, Anderson said. \n \n Robin Zielinski \u2014 Sun-News Aaliyah Doninguez, 11, stands on North Alameda Boulevard advising parishioners of Holy Cross Catholic Church that Mass is canceled on Sunday. \n \n \"I'm just thankful to God nobody was standing by the door, because there's usually always somebody standing there.

Susana Martinez said that only a \"coward\" would place an explosive device in a church. She vowed that the person responsible would be caught, and urged people to continue to attend church services. \n \n \"Whoever did this will feel the full pressure of the law,\" she said. \"If your intention was to bring fear to those who worship, you have failed.\" \n \n Robin Zielinski \u2014 Sun-News Las Cruces Police Officer Joseph Campa talks to Holy Cross Catholic Church parishioners on Sunday after an explosion occurred at the entrance of the church during Mass. \n \n State Police Chief Pete Kassetas said the acts were certainly intended to terrorize churchgoers, but he could not call it an act of terrorism at this time, or even confirm for certain that the two explosions were related. \n \n The Dona Ana County Sheriff's Office Bomb Squad, New Mexico State Police, and an NMSU canine unit are all assisting in the investigation, as are federal officials with the FBI, ATF and Department of Homeland Security, Las Cruces Police spokesman Dan Trujillo said. \n \n The earlier explosion at Calvary Baptist Church took place in a mailbox on a wall near the administrative entrance to the church, Trujillo said.

Llewellyn said he was a former special forces member with the Marines and recognized bomb parts that included an Eveready battery. He and fellow church member Mike Stewart kept churchgoers arriving for the 8:30 a.m. service from going into the building during the five to 10 minutes it took for police to arrive. Stewart was the one to notice the debris and damaged mailbox, the two men said. \n \n Llewellyn described the explosion as loud, and Stewart, who was inside, said it shook the building. Llewellyn said there were about 30 people inside the building when the explosion occurred. \n \n Kassetas said they were not releasing information on the type of explosive device used while the investigation is ongoing, but said they \"were not fireworks\" \n \n \"These devices were intended, I believe, to do harm and could have done harm to people.\" \n \n Trujillo said had no information yet as to possible motives, but police assume the two blasts are related. \n \n \"Just the fact that they were at churches the same day a half and hour apart or so, that leads us to believe it could be something related,\" he said. \n \n \"Somebody wanted attention, and somebody wanted to be very destructive against the Catholics, I guess,\" Monsignor John Anderson said. \"I don't know how else to read that.\" \n \n \"We'll well have to increase the security and have people in the parking lot all the time and have cameras in that gathering area to see who is there at all times.

(Robin Zielinski/Las Cruces Sun-News via AP) \n \n Three miles and only 20 minutes apart, dual explosions rocked two churches in Las Cruces, N.M., Sunday morning, injuring none but leaving both congregations shaken. \n \n The incidents are being investigated separately, Las Cruces Police Department spokesman Dan Trujillo said, but with an awareness of the \u201ctotality of the day\u2019s events.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s unlikely for us to have two incidents like this on the same day 20 minutes apart and have them not be connected,\u201d he told The Washington Post in a phone interview. \n \n The first explosion, set off by a device planted in a mailbox, went off around 8:20 a.m. just as congregants at Calvary Baptist Church in southern Las Cruces were beginning to gather for the morning\u2019s services. Twenty minutes later a second device exploded inside a trash can outside the Holy Cross Catholic Church just a short drive away, shattering the building\u2019s glass front and startling worshipers in the midst of their morning Mass. \n \n \u201cI was right in the middle of saying the words \u2018take and eat, this is my body\u2019 and there was a \u2018Pow!\u2019 I mean, I knew it had to be more than a gunshot,\u201d Monsignor John Anderson told the Las Cruces Sun-News. \u201cIt didn\u2019t know if it was a shotgun blast, I didn\u2019t know what. But it was very loud and I just kept on saying the words.\u201d \n \n Trujillo described the explosive devices as \u201cdangerous, much more dangerous than just fireworks or firecrackers,\u201d and intended to cause harm. But investigators do not yet have more details about what caused the explosions. Nor are they sure why these two churches in particular were targeted \u2014 Trujillo noted that Calvary Baptist is on the same street as at least five other churches, none of which were bombed. \n \n New Mexico State Police; the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives; the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Department of Homeland Security are investigating the incidents alongside several local law enforcement agencies. As of late Sunday night they had no information about potential suspects. \n \n New Mexico Gov. Susana Martinez (R) headed to her hometown, a city of about 100,000 just an hour\u2019s drive north of the Mexican border, for a news conference with law enforcement Sunday night. \n \n \u201cOnly a coward would place an explosive device in a place of peace and a place of worship,\u201d she told reporters. \u201c\u2026 If your intention was to bring fear to those who worship, you have failed. Our faith is too strong and our fellowship is unbreakable.\u201d \n \n Asked if the bombings were an act of terrorism, State Police Chief Pete Kassetas responded that he could only say for sure that the explosions certainly provoked terror. \n \n \u201cBut if you\u2019re asking me to put it in a nice, little, neat box to say that I can link this \u2026 to any one group or individual, we\u2019re not there yet,\u201d he said. \n \n Later, in response to a different question, he added, \u201cSomeone put some time and effort into this, we believe.\u201d \n \n The first explosion, at Calvary Baptist, went off outside an administrative entrance on the opposite side of the church from the door where worshipers were streaming in. About 30 people were already inside the building when they heard a loud noise and felt the building shake. \n \n Church member Dennis Llewellyn, who said he was a former special forces member with the Marines, recognized bomb parts among the debris. \n \n \u201cIt was a real bomb, I saw all the parts,\u201d he told the Sun-News. \n \n Services were already underway when the second device went off at Holy Cross Catholic Church 20 minutes later, the sound of splintering glass interrupting communion. The pastor finished the Lord\u2019s Prayer, then sent a deacon to investigate the noise. Minutes later police arrived. \n \n \u201cWe have it under control but we need you to leave the building,\u201d they instructed the congregation, college student and lifelong Holy Cross parishioner Ann-Marie Sullivan told the Sun-News. \n \n None of the roughly 200 people inside the building were injured, though the church\u2019s glass front was destroyed. The congregation was saved by the fact that the explosion happened during the communion; normally someone is posted at the building\u2019s entrance, Anderson told the Sun-News, but everyone had come inside for that part of the service. If the bomb had gone off just 10 minutes later, the church members would have been gathering in the building\u2019s entrance and it\u2019s likely several would have been hurt. \n \n He added that the church needs to increase its security, adding patrols to its parking lot and cameras to its front entrance in the wake of the incident. \n \n \u201cSomebody wanted attention, and somebody wanted to be very destructive against the Catholics, I guess,\u201d he told the Sun-News. \u201cI don\u2019t know how else to read that.\u201d",

The McAfee Labs Blog referred to it as a virus, a Trojan, and a worm. The term \"worm\" refers to a malicious program that can spread to other computers without any human interaction, so that last point had me worried. \n \n As it turns out, this threat isn't a worm. It can't attack your computer by itself. In fact, it can't do anything at all unless some goofball clicks the wrong link (though once that happens it can infect connected computers and USB drives).

Although McAfee did not disclose how widespread the attack was, around 4 p.m. Thursday afternoon, the subject of the spam e-mail, \"Here you have,\" was the second hottest search on Google trends. \n \n \"We do know that it's essentially an e-mail based worm that's propagating that has a link that alleges to be a pdf document that it wants the user to click on,\" Alperovitch said. \"In reality, it's a piece of malware that's obfuscating as a pdf and it has the capabilities to spread virally once it's installed on your machine.\" \n \n Later, the company published a report about the virus on its website, saying that the risk for both home and corporate e-mail is \"low.\" McAfee's report also identified the spam as a Trojan and said the origin is unknown. \n \n On its blog, McAfee said that because multiple variants of the worm are spreading, it \"may take some time to work through them all to paint a clearer picture.\" \n \n E-Mail Subject: 'Here You Have.' 'Just For You' \n \n One version of the spam e-mail simply says, \"Hello: This is The Document I told you about, you can find it here\" and includes a link that appears to be a pdf document. \n \n Another version of the worm includes the subject \"Just For you\" and says \"This is The Free Dowload Sex Movies,you can find it Here.\" \n \n If a user clicks the link and downloads the virus, it spreads to contacts in that individual's e-mail account and continues to propagate. McAfee also said that it attempts to stop and delete security services. McAfee says it has coverage for at least the main strain of the virus. \n \n If you receive the messages, McAfee says to delete the message without clicking the link and alert your IT office. \n \n Security firm Symantec said the worm appears to be a new malware attack but is similar to the \"Anna Kournikova\" virus from 2001, which also carried the subject \"Here you have.\" (The virus tricked users into opening an e-mail message supposedly containing a picture of tennis player Anna Kournikova.) \n \n Symantec speculates that the threat -- initially named Trojan.Horse but renamed to W32.Imsolk.A@mm -- originated from a botnet and appears to be hitting \"many, many companies indiscriminantly.\" \n \n \"Once the threat copies itself to another machine, if a user even opens the folder that contains the threat on this new machine, this will launch the threat and cause it to spread further through both email and over shared drives,\" the company wrote in a bulletin. \n \n Department of Homeland Security Officials Investigate Virus \n \n Department of Homeland Security officials are looking into the virus and the U.S. Computer Emergency Readiness Team and DHS National Cyber Security Division are expected to issue a bulletin later today. They will also conduct forensic analysis to try and determine where the worm originated. A DHS official said that several federal departments and agencies are experiencing the virus, although the official would only confirm NASA. \n \n \"US-CERT has received multiple reports from a number of federal agencies and private sector entities experiencing an email worm...US-CERT is in the process of collecting and analyzing samples of the malware and has developed and disseminated mitigation strategies,\" said DHS press secretary Amy Kudwa in a statement. \n \n A spokesman for the Florida Department of Transportation e-mail has been taken down at the agency because of the spam attack. He said six other agencies in Florida have also been hit by the virus. \n \n While the trojan hindered communications, it hasn't had a major impact on operations, he said. \n \n \"It's not life and death, a bridge hasn't collapsed and killed anybody,\" said Nelson Hill, chief information officer for the Florida Department of Transportation. \n \n Adobe systems on Tuesday advised computer security experts that there were vulnerabilities in the Adobe reader software, noting that hackers were looking to actively exploit a recently detected vulnerability. This could explain why the e-mail was being sent in a .pdf format. \n \n NASA: 'Houston We Have a Problem... Spam' \n \n As IT professionals raced to address the problem, annoyed employees took to Twitter to rant. \n \n \"Office servers offline, due to spam assault. No e-mail for anyone. Now maybe I can get some work done!\" posted one employee. \n \n \"The world is coming to an end. The \"here you have\" email virus just took down times square,\" joked another. \n \n NASA's Lunar Science Institute tweeted, \"Houston, we have a problem... it's called spam.\" \n \n ABC News' Jason Ryan, Marisa Bramwell, Lee Ferran and Sidney Wright contributed to this report.",

        "Document": "Rising temperatures due to global warming will make it harder for many aircraft around the world to take off in coming decades, says a new study. During the hottest parts of the day, 10 to 30 percent of fully loaded planes may have to remove some fuel, cargo or passengers, or else wait for cooler hours to fly, the study concludes. The study, which is the first such global analysis, appears today in the journal Climatic Change. \n \n \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost on airline and impact aviation operations around the world,\" said lead author Ethan Coffel, a Columbia University PhD. student. \n \n As air warms, it spreads out, and its density declines. In thinner air, wings generate less lift as a plane races along a runway. Thus, depending on aircraft model, runway length and other factors, at some point a packed plane may be unable to take off safely if the temperature gets too high. Weight must be dumped, or else the flight delayed or canceled. \n \n Average global temperatures have gone up nearly 1 degree Centigrade (1.8 Fahrenheit) since about 1980, and this may already be having an effect. In late June, American Airlines canceled more than 40 flights out of Phoenix, Ariz., when daytime highs of nearly 120 degrees made it too hot for smaller regional jets to take off. Worldwide, average temperatures are expected to go up as much as another 3 degrees C (5.4 degrees F) by 2100. But that is only part of the story; heat waves will probably become more prevalent, with annual maximum daily temperatures at airports worldwide projected to go up 4 to 8 degrees C (7.2 to 14.4 F) by 2080, according to the study. It is these heat waves that may produce the most problems. \n \n \"This points to the unexplored risks of changing climate on aviation,\" said coauthor Radley Horton, a climatologist at Columbia University's Lamont-Doherty Earth Observatory. \"As the world gets more connected and aviation grows, there may be substantial potential for cascading effects, economic and otherwise.\" Most studies so far have focused on how aviation may affect global warming (aircraft comprise about 2 percent of global greenhouse-gas emissions), not vice versa. But a handful of studies have warned that warming climate may increase dangerous turbulence along major air routes, and head winds that could lengthen travel times. Rising sea levels are already threatening to swamp some major airports. Coffel and Horton may be the only ones so far to look at takeoffs. \n \n In 2015, they published a smaller-scale paper, predicting up to four times more future temperature-related takeoff problems for the common Boeing 737-800 at Phoenix, as well as Denver, New York's LaGuardia and Washington's Ronald Reagan. The new study projects effects on a wide range of jets at these, plus 15 of the other busiest airports in the United States, Europe, the Mideast, China and south Asia. \n \n The authors estimate that if globe-warming emission continue unabated, fuel capacities and payload weights will have to be reduced by as much as 4 percent on the hottest days for some aircraft. If the world somehow manages to sharply reduce carbon emissions soon, such reductions may amount to as little as 0.5 percent, they say. Either figure is significant in an industry that operates on thin profit margins. For an average aircraft operating today, a 4 percent weight reduction would mean roughly 12 or 13 fewer passengers on an average 160-seat craft. This does not count the major logistical and economic effects of delays and cancellations that can instantly ripple from one air hub to another, said Horton. \n \n Some aircraft with lower temperature tolerances will far worse than others, and certain airports--those with shorter runways, in hotter parts of the world or at higher elevations, where the air is already thinner--will suffer more. For instance, facing LaGuardia's short runways, a Boeing 737-800 may have to offload weight half the time during the hottest days. Dubai, in the United Arab Emirates, might be worse; its runways are long, but its temperatures are already very high. Airports probably less affected because they are in temperate regions and have long runways include New York's JFK, London Heathrow and Paris's Charles de Gaulle. \n \n Horton said that some effects could be mitigated with new engine or body designs, or expanded runways. But modifications would come at a cost, as aircraft are already highly engineered for efficiency; and expanded runways in densely packed cities such as New York are not an option. \"The sooner climate can be incorporated into mid- and long-range plans, the more effective adaptation efforts can be,\" said Coffel. \n \n ### \n \n The paper was coauthored by Terence R. Thompson of Logistics Management Institute, a Virginia-based consulting company that studies aviation and other issues. \n \n The paper, \"The impacts of rising temperatures on aircraft takeoff performance,\" is available from the journal Climatic Change.

The reason was two-fold. First off, some jet engines risk catching on fire in extreme heat. And when air gets hot, it expands and becomes less dense\u2014so an airplane\u2019s wings can\u2019t generate enough lift to get off the ground. Planes either need to speed up during take-off or use a longer runway. \n \n But Phoenix\u2019s flight delays aren\u2019t a one-off event. As the Earth\u2019s climate undergoes a 1 to 3 degree Celsius warming over the next half-century, extreme heat waves will hit more frequently. Some of these heat waves will hit airports with short runways. Forget about rain delays or missing flight crews. At places like Washington\u2019s Reagan National Airport, New York\u2019s LaGuardia Airport, and Dubai International, the real trouble will come during heat waves. \n \n During the hottest part of the day, 10 to 30 percent of planes will have to offload cargo or people, according to a new study by graduate student Ethan Coffell and climate scientist Radley Horton at Columbia University. \u201cThis study shined a light on a potential vulnerability,\u201d Horton says. \u201cA lot of airplanes at full capacity are ill-equipped to take off on some of the world\u2019s runways when temperatures get really high.\u201d \n \n The scientists looked at five common commercial airplane models\u2014the Boeing 737-800, Airbus A320, Boeing 787-8, Boeing 777-300, and Airbus A380\u2014and calculated how their takeoffs would be affected at 19 airports around the world, based on projected temperatures from 27 different global climate models. The runways represented the most common climates, elevations, and runway conditions at busy airports around the world\u2014including US airports in Denver, Phoenix, Chicago, Atlanta, New York, Washington, DC, Los Angeles, Houston and Miami. \n \n The good news for air travelers is that London, Paris, and JFK in New York will be able to shrug off the worst of future heat waves. But a Boeing 777-300 departing from Dubai at the time of the daily highest temperature may be weight-restricted about 55 percent of the time according to the study, which appears today in the journal Climactic Science. Because of the short runways, airplanes at Washington\u2019s Reagan-National (7,170 feet) and New York\u2019s LaGuardia (7,000 feet) will also have to lighten their load to get off the ground. Expanding the runways probably won\u2019t work, given that they are either sandwiched along the Potomac River or Jamaica Bay. \n \n Heat waves aren\u2019t the only problem facing the aviation industry as the Earth\u2019s climate changes rapidly. Other scientists have calculated that severe turbulence\u2014the kind that sends drink carts flying and sometimes even unbuckled passengers\u2014will increase over certain transatlantic routes that follow the meandering jet streams. \n \n Paul D. Williams, an atmospheric scientist at the University of Reading who published on the connection between climate change and turbulence this past year, thinks the industry needs to start dealing with climate change more aggressively. They could develop engines that produce fewer greenhouse gases, for one, as well as adapt its planes to the future world. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a benefit of climate change to aviation,\u201d Williams says. \u201cAll the published studies have been about thing getting worse.\u201d \n \n There are plenty of solutions out there, some more complicated than others. Flights may have to leave earlier in the day when its cooler, Horton suggests, or aircraft manufacturers may have to make planes lighter. Or engineers could step in, building some kind of special new wings that generate additional lift. There\u2019s one other option that probably won\u2019t happen: leaving three or four paying customers back at the terminal in order to make the takeoff weight. ||||| NEW YORK (Thomson Reuters Foundation) - More frequent heat waves and rising temperatures due to global warming may ground up to a third of airplanes worldwide during hot days in decades to come with some airports in New York and Dubai likely to be hard hit, a study showed on Thursday. \n \n Airlines may increasingly be forced to cut their loads of passengers, cargo or fuel in order to take off safely because warming air lessens the ability of airplane wings to generate lift, according to U.S. researchers. \n \n Worldwide, average temperatures are expected to climb some 5.5 degrees Fahrenheit (3 Celsius) by 2100, researchers said. \n \n But it is more prevalent heat waves that pose a larger threat to the airline industry, they said in a study published in the journal Climate Change. \n \n Annual maximum daily temperatures at airports could rise by 7 to 14 degrees Fahrenheit (4 to 8 Celsius) by 2080, they found, leading to more costly delays in take-offs or cancellations. \n \n During the hottest parts of the day, between 10 and 30 percent of fully loaded planes may have to dump weight in order to begin their journey. \n \n The phenomenon could force the aviation industry to brace for thinner profit margins, the authors said. \n \n A full 160-seat aircraft trying to safely take off in searing heat may, for instance, need to remove 13 passenger, said the study. \n \n But the costs of delays or cancellations could also disrupt other sectors of the economy as they trickle down, they said. \n \n \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost,\" said Ethan Coffel, the study's lead author and a researcher at Columbia University in New York City, in a statement. \n \n Airports likely to be most affected according to the researchers' appraisal of 19 major airports include New York's LaGuardia, due to short runways, and Dubai International Airport in the United Arab Emirates, because of scorching heat. \n \n Projections found the least affected airports included New York's John F. Kennedy International Airport, London's Heathrow and Paris' Charles de Gaulle. \n \n Last month, major airlines were forced to delay or cancel dozens of flights out of Las Vegas and Phoenix airports, citing difficulty in operating aircraft amid a heat wave. \n \n Previous research has found that changes in climate may increase turbulence on flights, the researchers said. \n \n They said their study was the first such global analysis.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Remember in June when it got too hot for planes to take off in Phoenix? A new study suggests stories like that will become quite common in the not-too-distant future. Via Reuters, the study published in Climatic Change estimates that rising temperatures could leave up to one-third of planes grounded during heat waves in the coming decades. The problem centers around the wings\u2019 capacity for lift, which is lessened in warmer conditions. By 2100, worldwide average temperatures are expected to rise by 5.4 degrees Fahrenheit. To safely take off, airlines would need to make adjustments during the hottest part of the day, with 10% to 30% of planes affected. Full flights will either stay grounded until conditions cool down or lighten their loads by removing fuel, cargo, or passengers, per a release at EurekAlert. Think 12 to 13 people asked to leave a 160-person passenger plane. \"Our results suggest that weight restriction may impose a non-trivial cost,\" one of the study\u2019s lead authors says. Wired reports that among the airports studied, New York\u2019s LaGuardia and Washington\u2019s Reagan-National fared poorly because of short runways, as did Dubai International Airport, where extreme heat could force reduced loads up to 55% of the time during peak temperatures. Better news: New York's JFK wouldn't be much affected. Delayed departures won't be the only hassle. Scientists say severe turbulence would become more common. \u201cI\u2019ve yet to see a benefit of climate change to aviation,\u201d says atmospheric scientist Paul Williams, who believes it\u2019s high time for the airline industry to prepare and adapt.

This highly anticipated discussion will address Armstrong's past achievements, Livestrong foundation, and the doping allegations against him.",
        "Document": "Last Updated, Wednesday, 11:07 a.m. The year before his seventh and final Tour de France victory, Lance Armstrong offered to donate \u201cin excess of $150,000\u2033 to the antidoping agency in charge of keeping American athletes from using performance-enhancing drugs, according to the organization\u2019s chief executive. \n \n The latest accusation against Armstrong, the disgraced former cyclist, was made by the current head of the United States Anti-Doping Agency, Travis Tygart, in an interview with CBS News posted online on Tuesday. In October, Usada stripped Armstrong of all of his titles and barred him from competition for life following the release of a 202-page report into what the agency called \u201cthe most sophisticated, professionalized and successful doping program that sport has ever seen.\u201d \n \n As my colleague Juliet Macur reported, Armstrong, who has so far denied all allegations of cheating, \u201chas told associates and antidoping officials that he is considering publicly admitting that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions during his cycling career.\u201d Late Tuesday, Oprah Winfrey announced that she \u201cwill speak exclusively with Lance Armstrong in his first no-holds-barred interview,\u201d to be broadcast next week on her network. \n \n BREAKING NEWS: Looking forward to this conversation with @lancearmstrong: http://t.co/GwSmBhdW #NextChapter \u2014 Oprah Winfrey (@Oprah) 9 Jan 13 \n \n As the cycling journalist Lionel Birnie notes, the Oprah Winfrey Network is a joint venture with Discovery Communications, the broadcaster that sponsored Armstrong\u2019s team in 2005. \n \n Lance is going on Oprah, partly-produced by Discovery Channel, sponsors of Lance\u2019s 7th and final fraudulent Tour win. Somehow fitting. \u2014 Lionel Birnie (@lioneljbirnie) 9 Jan 13 \n \n Samantha Lane, a reporter for The Age in Australia, pointed out on Twitter that Winfrey and Armstrong looked comfortable together in a photograph published in the May 2004 issue of O, The Oprah Magazine with an interview of the cyclist before that year\u2019s Tour de France. \n \n Oprah & Lance, in happier times (pic from her website). http://t.co/TMpMfYfk \u2014 Sam Lane (@SamJaneLane) 9 Jan 13 \n \n The photograph showed Armstrong in his Discovery Channel uniform and Winfrey, leaning on his shoulder, wearing a yellow, Livestrong bracelet. \n \n The network\u2019s logo was emblazoned across the victor\u2019s yellow jersey Armstrong wore on the top step of the podium in Paris that year, as he lectured \u201cthe people that don\u2019t believe in cycling, the cynics and the skeptics.\u201d \n \n Directly addressing those who accused him of doping that day, Armstrong said, \u201cI\u2019m sorry for you, I\u2019m sorry you can\u2019t dream big and I\u2019m sorry you don\u2019t believe in miracles, but this is one hell of a race, this is a great sporting event and you should stand around and believe.

He then revealed that someone representing Armstrong had offered to give the American antidoping agency more than $150,000 at some point in 2004. \u201cIt was a clear conflict of interest for Usada,\u201d Tygart said. \u201cWe had no hesitation in rejecting that offer.\u201d Pressed further about the amount of the proposed donation, Tygart said that it was about $250,000. \n \n In another portion of the interview, broadcast on the CBS Evening News on Tuesday, Tygart said that Armstrong had tried to intimidate former teammates who had testified to a federal grand jury about his doping. The official also revealed that he personally had received death threats as a result of his investigation into the cancer survivor who was once a hero to millions. ||||| Story highlights Lance Armstrong has agreed to 90-minute interview, Oprah Winfrey's network announces \n \n Release says Armstrong is expected to talk about doping allegations \n \n Armstrong has been working out in Hawaii, doing triathlon training \n \n Lance Armstrong will give his first television interview since being stripped of his Tour de France titles to Oprah Winfrey, her network announced Tuesday. \n \n A news release from the Oprah Winfrey Network said the 90-minute \"no-holds-barred\" interview will air at 9 p.m. ET January 17 and will be simulcast on Oprah.com. \n \n Winfrey will ask the disgraced cycling star to address the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency's report, which said there was overwhelming evidence he was directly involved in a sophisticated doping program, the statement said. \n \n The International Cycling Union, which choose not to appeal the USADA's lifetime ban, stripped Armstrong of his record seven Tour victories in October. \n \n The World Anti-Doping Agency also agreed with the sanctions, which means Armstrong may not compete in sports governed by WADA code. \n \n JUST WATCHED What's the truth with Lance Armstrong?

Since the ban he has entered two non-sanctioned events. \n \n According to his Twitter feed, Armstrong has been biking, running and swimming in Hawaii. The Winfrey interview will take place at Armstrong's home in Austin, Texas. \n \n The New York Times reported last week that Armstrong, 41, was contemplating publicly admitting he used illegal performance-enhancing drugs. Such an admission might lead toward Armstrong regaining his eligibility. \n \n Attorney Tim Herman, in a recent e-mail to CNN Sports, did not address whether Armstrong told associates -- as reported by the newspaper -- that he was considering an admission. \n \n Armstrong has repeatedly and vehemently denied that he used banned performance-enhancing drugs as well as illegal blood transfusions during his cycling career. \n \n In the past, Armstrong has argued that he took more than 500 drug tests and never failed. In its 202-page report that detailed Armstrong's alleged use of performance-enhancing drugs and blood transfusions, the USADA said it had tested Armstrong less than 60 times and the International Cycling Union conducted about 215 tests. \n \n The agency did not say that Armstrong ever failed a test, but his former teammates testified as to how they beat tests or avoided the tests altogether. \n \n The New York Times, citing unnamed associates and anti-doping officials, said Armstrong has been in discussions with USADA officials and hopes to meet with David Howman, chief of the World Anti-Doping Agency. The newspaper said none of the people with knowledge of Armstrong's situation wanted to be identified because it would jeopardize their access to information on the matter. \n \n Under World Anti-Doping Agency rules, an athlete who confesses to using performance-enhancing drugs may be eligible for a reinstatement. \n \n Armstrong has been an icon for his cycling feats and celebrity, bringing more status to a sport wildly popular in some nations but lacking big-name recognition, big money and mass appeal in the United States. \n \n He fought back from testicular cancer to win the Tour from 1999 to 2005. He raised millions via his Lance Armstrong Foundation to help cancer victims and survivors, an effort illustrated by trendy yellow \"LiveSTRONG\" wristbands that helped bring in the money. \n \n But Armstrong has long been dogged by doping allegations, with compatriot Floyd Landis -- who was stripped of his 2006 Tour de France title after failing a drug test -- making a series of claims in 2011. \n \n Armstrong sued the USADA last year to stop its investigation of him, arguing it did not have the right to prosecute him. But after a federal judge dismissed the case, Armstrong said he would no longer participate in the investigation. \n \n In October 2012, Armstrong was stripped of his titles and banned from cycling. Weeks later, he stepped down from the board of his foundation, Livestrong. \n \n It is unclear whether Armstrong would face criminal prosecution for perjury should he confess. Armstrong was involved in several cases where he gave sworn testimony that he never used banned drugs.",

Daniel St. Hubert is in custody, the arrest made soon after police publicly identified him as a suspect. As the Daily News explains, the break in the case came when investigators matched DNA found on a knife left at the scene with the state's criminal database. Hubert has a long criminal record for offenses including assault and had been paroled on May 23, reports the New York Times. Police haven't called him a suspect in another fatal stabbing that occurred just two nights earlier, but the investigation is continuing. The same brand of knife\u2014a model discontinued 10 years ago\u2014was left behind in the slaying of 18-year-old Tanaya Copeland, and the man seen fleeing that scene had the same general description as Hubert. The 6-year-old boy who was killed, PJ Avitto, had gotten into an elevator with friend Mikayla Capers in their Brooklyn housing complex before being attacked. Mikayla remains in critical condition."

        "Summary": "The article discusses Tunisia's events, focusing on Mohamed Bouazizi's role and the protests against Ben Ali's American-backed government. These protests, driven by economic woes, corruption, and repression, resonated across the Middle East, inspiring countries like Egypt. Hillary Rodham Clinton critiqued Arab leadership, and a solidarity protest occurred in Cairo. Gunfire erupted near the Interior Ministry, and Fouad Mebazaa became interim president after Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia. Issam Chebbi of the Progressive Democratic Party called for national unity amid the broader regional implications.",
        "Document": "That the events in Tunisia took place far beyond the region\u2019s traditional centers of power did little to diminish the enthusiasm they seemed to generate. In fact, the very spectacle of crowds surging into the streets and overwhelming decades of accumulated power in the hands of a highly centralized, American-backed government seemed an antidote to the despair of past years \u2014 carnage in Iraq, divisions among Palestinians and Israeli intransigence and the yawning divide between ruler and ruled on almost every question of foreign policy. \n \n The protests\u2019 success gripped a region whose residents have increasingly complained of governments that seem incapable of meeting their demands and are bereft of any ideology except perpetuating power. The combustible mix that inspired them \u2014 economic woes and revulsion at corruption and repression \u2014 seemed to echo in so many other countries in the Middle East, American allies like Egypt foremost among them. \n \n Al Jazeera headlined its broadcasts: \u201cTunisia ... the street creates change.\u201d \n \n Mohammed al-Maskati, a blogger in Bahrain, put it more bluntly on Twitter. \u201cIt actually happened in my lifetime!\u201d he wrote. \u201cAn Arab nation woke up and said enough.\u201d \n \n Through the eight years of the Bush administration, democratization was at least a rhetorical priority of American policy in the Middle East, even as the United States maintained its support for Egypt, Saudi Arabia and other authoritarian governments in the region. On Thursday, as the protests in Tunisia were escalating, Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton issued a scathing critique of Arab leadership and the region\u2019s political and economic stagnation. Her comments seemed one attempt to reposition the United States, which backed Tunisia\u2019s dictatorial leader as a partner against terrorism. \n \n Photo \n \n In the end, the most dramatic change in the old Arab order in years was inspired by Mohamed Bouazizi, the 26-year-old university graduate who could find work only as a fruit and vegetable vendor. He set himself on fire in a city square in December when the police seized his cart and mistreated him. \n \n A Facebook page called Tunisians hailed him as \u201cthe symbol of the Tunisian revolution.\u201d \u201cGod have mercy on you, Tunisia\u2019s martyr, and on the all free martyrs of Tunisia,\u201d it read. \u201cOne candle burns to create light and one candle beats all oppression.\u201d \n \n In Egypt, his name came up at a small solidarity protest. \n \n \u201cEgypt needs a man like Mohamed Bouazizi,\u201d said Abdel-Halim Qandil, a journalist and opposition leader who joined dozens of others at the Tunisian Embassy. \n \n Newsletter Sign Up Continue reading the main story Please verify you're not a robot by clicking the box.

In Egypt, protesters, often lacking in numbers, are occasionally beset by divisions between secular and religious activists. The mass protests in Lebanon that followed the assassination of Rafik Hariri, a former prime minister, in February 2005 ended up deepening divisions in a country almost evenly split over questions of ideology, sectarian loyalty and foreign patrons. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Tunisians\u2019 grievances were as specific as universal: rising food prices, corruption, unemployment and the repression of a state that viewed almost all dissent as subversion. \n \n Smaller protests, many of them over rising prices, have already taken place in countries like Morocco, Egypt, Algeria and Jordan. Egypt, in particular, seems to bear at least a passing resemblance to Tunisia \u2014 a heavy-handed security state with diminishing popular support and growing demands from an educated, yet frustrated, population. \n \n In Jordan, hundreds protested the cost of food in several cities, even after the government hastily announced measures to bring the prices down. Libya abolished taxes and customs duties on food products, and Morocco tried to offset a surge in grain prices. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s the creeping realization that more and more people are being marginalized and pauperized and that, increasingly, life is more difficult,\u201d said Rami Khouri, director of the Issam Fares Institute at the American University of Beirut. \u201cYou need little events that capture the spirit of the time. Tunisia best captures that in the Arab world.\u201d \n \n Despite the enthusiasm, the scene Friday night in Cairo might serve as caution. \n \n The protesters who gathered at the Tunisian Embassy in the upscale neighborhood of Zamalek chanted slogans into a megaphone and waved red Tunisian flags. They went through a litany of the region\u2019s strongmen \u2014 from Col. Muammar el-Qaddafi of Libya to Hosni Mubarak of Egypt \u2014 and warned each that his day of reckoning was coming. \n \n \u201cDown, down with Hosni Mubarak!\u201d some chanted. \n \n \u201cBen Ali, you fraud! Mubarak, you fraud! Qaddafi, you fraud!\u201d others shouted. \n \n They were ringed by police officers in black berets, and outnumbered by them, as well. They had little room to maneuver. And an hour later, the protesters went their way, a Tunisian flag flying from one of the cars, as it ventured down a largely empty street. ||||| Hassene Dridi, AP \n \n Sponsored Links \n \n TUNIS, Tunisia -- Gunfire rang out Sunday in central Tunis near the Interior Ministry, as police and troops try to calm tensions after the president's ouster.Issam Chebbi, a senior member of the main opposition party PDP, said a gunfight also broke out Sunday between security forces and unidentified attackers in front of the opposition party headquarters. A big crowd was gathered in front of the building and heavy security was deployed in the area.Soon afterward, repeated volleys of gunfire were heard nearby, near the Interior Ministry. The source of the shots was unclear.The violence broke out as Tunisia sped toward a new future after its iron-fisted leader fled. A new interim president ordered the country's first multiparty government to be formed.But violence in many parts of the capital heaped doubt on hopes for a smooth transition to a new era.The omnipresent posters of ex-President Zine El Abidine Ben Ali were coming down, a vivid signal to citizens that Tunisia is moving on after 23 years of autocratic rule. Even the main state TV station changed its name.For Tunisians who protested for four weeks - with police shooting dozens to death - the announcement that a \"government of national unity\" would be formed opens the possibility of a leap toward democracy in this Muslim country in North Africa whose modernity clashed with Ben Ali's repressive rule.The nation must wait 60 days to see whether the party that maintained the ex-leader in power gets an upper hand in the new government, locking the old system back in place.The 74-year-old Ben Ali fled his country Friday for Saudi Arabia, literally chased out by angry legions of citizens protesting joblessness, corruption and lack of freedoms - a first for an Arab country. Numerous citizens laid a large measure of blame for his fate on his in-laws, supremely wealthy and considered just as corrupt.The interim president, Fouad Mebazaa, the former president of the lower house of parliament, was named Saturday - the second change of power in fewer than 24 hours. He quickly ordered the creation of a unity government that by its nature would include the opposition which had been frozen out under Ben Ali.\"We can start to hope,\" said a founder of the main opposition party, the Progressive Democratic Party, Nejib Chebbi. The question now, he said, is whether a new government will be pluralistic or again dominated by Ben Ali's ruling RCD party. \"If the RCD is dominant, we're not out of the woods.\"The Tunis airport reopened Saturday but the state of emergency declared Thursday continued. Instability ruled in the streets and spotter helicopters churned in the sky above the capital.Fire blackened the main Tunis train station, torched along with large stores and scattered shops as troublemakers defied a curfew Friday night.At least 42 people were killed Saturday in a prison fire in a resort town and the director of another prison let 1,000 inmates flee after a deadly rebellion.Assailants fired on police guarding the Interior Ministry in a bold attack on the symbol of the Ben Ali reign and police returned fire, battening down the city center. An Associated Press Television News cameraman near the scene saw two bodies on the ground. Their identities were not known.Street violence took a new form Saturday with marauding gangs sacking homes in at least one wealthy neighborhood and residents, armed with golf clubs, forming self-styled vigilante committees to protect themselves.Rumors were rife in a chaotic Tunisia, with some citizens voicing suspicions the gangs were made up of Ben Ali loyalists bent on sewing chaos in the country.Many Tunisians also expressed worries about what lies ahead.\"This all happened in three days. Maybe tomorrow we can't eat,\" said Mohsen Yacoubi, referring to the mostly closed shops in the capital. He said Ben Ali's departure should have been negotiated over time. \"Instead, it's war right away.\"Soldiers took up posts around Tunis, with tanks guarding strategic facilities like ministries and some major crossroads. The army presence was clear but discrete. Police were everywhere.Two quick changes in leadership since Ben Ali bowed out fed rumors that the army was the shadow ruler in a country without a government.Longtime Prime Minister Mohammed Ghannouchi, a Ben Ali ally, stepped stepped in briefly Friday to assume power after Ben Ali fled, leaving open the possibility that the longtime leader could return. But on Saturday, Constitutional Council President Fethi Abdennadher declared the president's departure permanent and gave lawmaker Mebazaa 60 days in which to organize new elections.Hours later, 77-year-old Mebazaa was sworn in and announced that all parties will be consulted \"without exception or exclusion.\"\"Ben Ali was a military dictator and everyone knows it,\" said Nouredine Jouini, 56, a former mechanical designer now guarding a closed up mall on Tunis' main avenue. But, he added, \"The people aren't dumb. We know the prime minister was appointed by defense forces .... But it won't stay this way. Tunisia will function.\"Streets were flush with police, for decades the most visible - and most feared - force in Tunisia. Cars were checked, particularly rental cars considered suspect as gangs combed the city.In the idyllic coastal resort of Monastir, a prison fire killed 42 people, coroner Tarek Mghirbi told The Associated Press on Saturday. The cause of the fire was not immediately clear. In Mahdia, a resort town further down the coast, inmates were set free after a rebellion by prisoners who set fire to the facility holding some 1,000. Soldiers opened fire and five inmates were killed, a top local official said, asking not to be identified because of security concerns.A Paris-based photographer, Lucas Mebrouk Dolega of the EPA photo agency, was in critical condition Saturday after being hit in the face by a tear gas canister.An Associated Press photographer saw soldiers fire warning shots and try to stop looters from sacking the supermarket in Ariana, north of the capital, to no avail. Shops near the Tunis bazaar were also looted.Public television station TV7 - just renamed Tunisian National Television - broadcast phone calls from residents of working-class neighborhoods on the capital's outskirts, describing attacks against their homes by knife-wielding assailants. Young boys were seen armed with long sticks along some streets.The wealthy were not spared, with some homes sacked in the upper class La Marsa neighborhood.Tunisian television has urged citizens to organize patrols, and men and boys in the tony Tunis neighborhood of El Menzah set up makeshift barricades and armed themselves with golf clubs and baseball bats for patrols against intruders.Businesses owned by member's of Ben Ali's family also appeared to be targets. The family of the ex-president's wife, Leila Trabelsi, has financial interests in wide-ranging sectors from banking to car dealerships. A branch of the Zeitouna bank in Tunis founded by Ben Ali's son-in-law was torched, as were vehicles made by Kia, Fiat and Porsche - brands distributed in Tunisia by members of the ruling family.\"This isn't good at all. I'm very afraid for the kids and myself,\" said Lilia Ben Romdhan, a mother of three in central Tunis. \"If (Ben Ali) had stayed in the country it would be better.\"Saudi King Abdullah's palace ended hours of speculation about where Ben Ali had fled to, confirming Saturday that the ousted president and some family members had landed in Saudi Arabia. The palace said the kingdom welcomed him with a wish for \"peace and security to return to the people of Tunisia.\"A source inside the kingdom said he was in the small city of Abha, about 310 miles (500 kilometers) south of Jeddah - taken there to avoid sparking any possible demonstrations by Tunisians living in the larger, seaside city of Jeddah. He spoke on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.The whereabouts of all family members were unclear.The French government said some members are in France - former colonial ruler - but are \"not welcome.\" Spokesman Francois Baroin told France-Info radio that Ben Ali's family \"have not shown a desire to stay on French soil and are going to leave.\"Thousands of tourists were being evacuated from the Mediterranean nation, where tourism is a chief industry.Ben Ali's downfall sent a warning to other autocratic leaders across the Arab world, especially because he did not seem vulnerable until very recently and managed his country of 10 million better than many other Middle Eastern nations.However, the new era he dubbed \"The Change\" - starting when he snatched power from the nation's founder, President Habib Bourguiba, in a bloodless palace coup in 1987 - never fully materialized.The improved quality of life for many failed to keep up with the increased limits on civil rights like freedom of expression and a growing reputation as a police state - invisible to the tourists flocking to the country's Mediterranean beaches.The unemployment rate stands officially at 14 percent but is thought to be far higher among the young - who make up 52 percent of Tunisia's 10 million inhabitants.The self-immolation, and eventual death, of a 26-year-old university graduate selling fruits in central Tunisia triggered a dizzying series of riots that moved to the capital and, relayed by social media like Facebook, spun into general anger over the regime.Nicolas Garriga, Oleg Cetinic in Tunis, Hassan Ammar in Doha, Qatar and Angela Doland and Jenny Barchfield in Paris contributed to this report. ||||| The leadership of this troubled country changed hands for the second time in less than 24 hours Saturday as security forces and ordinary Tunisians struggled to quell mayhem that some have attributed to henchmen loyal to ousted President Zine el Abidine ben Ali Fouad Mebazaa, president of the lower house of the parliament, was sworn in as chief of state amid fast-moving political developments and chaotic lawlessness that have transformed Tunisia into a symbol of revolution in the Arab world.Mebazaa, 77, became the national president less than a day after Ben Ali fled to Saudi Arabia , handing power to his prime minister, Mohamed Ghannouchi, whose appointment sparked new demonstrations and questions about constitutional propriety. Mebazaa promised in a televised speech to consult with all political parties before holding elections within 60 days.\"I urge you all, and all dynamic forces of political parties, national organizations and components of civil society to put national interest first and to help the armed forces and national security in maintaining security and in protecting private and public property, and to restore calm and tranquillity to all citizens,\" he said.With video of the uprising airing constantly on satellite television throughout the region, the events in Tunisia have captivated Arabs who hope it will inspire the toppling of other entrenched authoritarian regimes. That has raised the stakes for a people's power rebellion that could be threatened by the continuing violence.Tension and confusion gripped the streets, where many residents spent hours searching for bread and other food.Army tanks were positioned in the heart of Tunis, along the capital's main Avenue Habib Bourguiba . Death toll figures were not available, but scores of people across the nation have died in the unrest, including 57 reportedly killed Saturday in an inferno at a prison.As a 5 p.m. curfew approached, surly young men appeared to be gathering steam for another night of clashes with police officers, who stalked sidewalks wearing riot gear and holding clubs, menacing pedestrians who didn't move quickly enough.As night fell, occasional bursts of gunfire could be heard throughout Tunis and its suburbs, as well as the occasional roar of army helicopters roaming the skies.Common criminals and overzealous young demonstrators have contributed to the spasm of looting and violence in this previously placid and tightly controlled North African country. But just as loyalists to Iraq's Saddam Hussein set off fires and released prisoners in the wake of his 2003 ouster by U.S.-led forces, security officials loyal to the autocratic Ben Ali, many Tunisians suspect, have played a role in the unrest here.\"These are not ordinary people,\" said Bochra Belhaj Hmida, a lawyer and human rights activist. \"They are at risk because they tortured people. They are going to be condemned for their crimes if they are arrested.\"The country's constitutional court ruled Saturday that the departure of Ben Ali, driven out of office Friday after weeks of protests over rising food prices, unemployment and a lack of political freedom, was permanent. And France , the former colonial power that had long backed Ben Ali, asked relatives of the former president who had entered the country to leave and announced the launch of investigations of suspicious money transfers between Tunisia and France.Many Tunisians suspect that former members of Ben Ali's presidential guard, his most brutal adjutants in the Interior Ministry and loyalists in his ruling Constitutional Democratic Rally were fomenting the violence to discredit the protesters and contribute to chaos that would justify harsh security measures.\"These are people from the ex-government who are orchestrating everything,\" said Mokhtar Trifi, president of the Tunisian Human Rights League, an opposition group.Officials of the interim government could not be reached for comment. But there were signs that security forces loyal to the interim government, especially the army, were trying to beat back efforts by the former regime to spread chaos.Al Jazeera pan-Arab satellite television network reported the arrest of Ali Seriati, the head of Ben Ali's despised presidential guard. In the capital's November 7 Square, police fatally shot two of their own, explaining to a European journalist at the scene that the pair were former regime loyalists who were responsible for crimes.Mohammad ben Ghomdhan, head of a small socialist political party, Renewal, that is conferring with the interim government, said officials had told him Saturday that during the preceding two days, soldiers at army checkpoints had seized two armored Interior Ministry vehicles filled with weapons.On television shows, on the Internet and in the few cafes that remained open in the capital, many said they feared that security officials close to Ben Ali also were responsible for an outbreak of violence at the country's prisons. Al Jazeera cited a medical source as saying 57 people had died in a fire at a prison in Monastir, about 80 miles southeast of the capital, amid reports of attempted escapes at at least two other detention facilities.Al Jazeera also reported that political prisoners held at Borj Roumi prison in the northern port city of Bizerte had been released. It was not clear who had given the order to free them.On the streets, the tension between the population and the police, which answers to the Interior Ministry, was palpable, as was the higher status that Tunisians accord their army.When police officers tried to detain a young man at the square near the Republic Metro station, a crowd waiting for a tram erupted with fury, moving toward the officers and tossing rocks. The police fired teargas volleys, but the crowd only got angrier and moved closer.\"We are not afraid!\" they chanted.A group of soldiers ran into the square to intervene, forcing the police to release the man. The crowd cheered the man as he boarded the tramway platform.Numerous videos posted on the Internet during the weeks of protest showed police officers in uniform smashing shop windows and setting fires. In the hours after Ben Ali stepped down, residents of the Manar and Menzah neighborhoods of Tunis reported spotting vans dropping off people armed with clubs and canisters of gasoline to start fires. Some of the witnesses said the vehicles were escorted by police.Ben Ghomdhan said that unlike in post-invasion Iraq, where the U.S. disbanded the army and regime stalwarts were able to organize an insurgency in the ensuing power vacuum, Tunisia's interim government and relatively popular army were already a step ahead of the Ben Ali loyalists.\"I think they cannot win,\" he said. \"These networks have been identified, from the information that I have so far. Their chief, Seriati, has been arrested, and many of his networks have already been arrested.\"",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Tunisia got a new interim president today\u2014parliamentary leader Fouad Mebazaa\u2014who is technically the third leader in 24 hours, notes the Los Angeles Times. He takes over from the previous interim president, who briefly held power when longtime leader El Abidine Ben Ali fled the country in the face of mass protests over rising prices, joblessness, corruption, repression, you name it. The storyline continues to shape up as one that could set a historical precedent\u2014an Arab populace rising up against its leader. Anthony Shadid, New York Times: \"The most enthusiastic suggested it was the Arab world\u2019s Gdansk, the birthplace of Solidarity in Poland, which heralded the end to Communist rule in Eastern Europe. That seemed premature, particularly because the contours of the government emerging in Tunisia were still unclear.\" Shadi Hamid, Huffington Post: \"No one should underestimate what happened yesterday in Tunisia. If the revolution succeeds, it may very well prove to be one of the most important moments in recent Arab history. It will alter the calculus not only for Arab regimes\u2014who are watching very, very nervously\u2014but for Western powers that have long oriented their Middle East policy around seemingly stable, autocratic governments.\" Click for the latest as chaos continues on the streets."

That was just the first salvo of an intensified campaign against the terror group following last Friday's Paris attacks. \n \n The question, however, is whether Anonymous' effort and that of a growing number of like-minded digital vigilantes in recent months will have any impact on the militants' digital networks, or are they only hindering government efforts to disrupt the jihadi group. \n \n In a YouTube video Monday, an individual wearing the collective's trademark Guy Fawkes mask promised that Anonymous activists from around the world would hunt down the Islamic State. \"We are going to launch the biggest ever operation against you,\" the masked individual warned. \"Expect very many cyberattacks.\" (A slightly different English language version of the video is available here.) \n \n Following the deadly attacks on the satirical newspaper Charlie Hebdo earlier this year, Anonymous launched a campaign dubbed #OpISIS to expose and destroy websites, social media accounts, and e-mail addresses of those it considered as affiliated with the terror group. Since then, it has claimed credit for shutting down several websites, and exposing e-mails, private networks, Internet addresses, and more than 9,000 Twitter accounts allegedly being used by Islamic State (ISIS) activists. \n \n It's unclear how exactly Anonymous plans on escalating that effort with it new #OpParis campaign launched over the weekend. According to Anonymous, it has already taken down more than 3,800 pro-ISIS Twitter accounts following the Paris attacks. Members of the collective are now apparently working on setting up teams for intelligence gathering, intelligence analysis and dissemination as part of a broader, more organized effort to hit ISIS capabilities online. \n \n Supporters and sympathizers of ISIS have used social media channels and the Internet extensively to communicate, to recruit, and to coordinate supporters across continents. By going after the online accounts used by members and supporters of the group, Anonymous hopes to degrade and diminish the ability for ISIS to communicate and proselytize using the Internet. \n \n But its penchant for doling out vigilante style justice replete with hyperbolic messages of vengeance and retribution may not be quite what\u2019s needed now, say analysts. For one thing, regardless of how successful Anonymous might prove in exposing Twitter accounts and shutting down websites, it's simple for ISIS supporters to reestablish new ones. \n \n In fact, many ISIS supporters are likely using the same tactics that members of Anonymous and other hacktivist groups use to stay ahead of those following them, says Joe Gallop head of the hacktivism intelligence practice at iSight Partners. The group behind the Paris attacks, for instance, may have used encrypted chat technology to communicate with each other, a tactic that hacktivists have long used to stay under the law enforcement radar, Mr. Gallop said. \n \n \"Terrorist organizations are just taking a page out of the hacktivist playbook,\" he says. In the same way that it's hard to take down Twitter accounts belonging to groups such as Anonymous, it's hard to completely curtail the ability to terror groups to communicate simply by shutting down Twitter accounts and taking down websites. \"What they are doing is more of simple harassment. In the end it is not going to help law enforcement to prevent an actual physical attack like what happened in Paris,\" Gallop said. \n \n There's also the question of whether efforts by Anonymous and others to take down sites and channels that terrorist supporters might be using to communicate could actually disrupt law enforcement investigations. \n \n When such activities are not undertaken in coordination with counterterrorism practitioners from within government, the actions of groups such as Anonymous can become counterproductive, says Michael Smith II, principal and chief operating officer at Kronos Advisory, a strategic advisory firm. \n \n \"Unless these activities are being coordinated with investigators who possess the authority to disrupt terrorists\u2019 activities, there is a good chance these activities will prove disruptive in relation to ongoing investigations,\" Mr. Smith warns. \n \n Smith currently acts as an intermediary in funneling ISIS-related data, collected by a group called Ghost Security Group, to government counter-terrorism officials. The focus is on passing along information gathered by the group related to ISIS attack plots and recruitment efforts. \n \n Members of Ghost Security Group previously belonged to GhostSec, a group of hacktivists that like Anonymous has been working to disrupt the online activities of Islamic terror groups such as ISIS, Al Qaeda and Al Shabab. In fact, GhostSec was one of two hacktivist groups that worked with Anonymous to expose the Twitter accounts of ISIS supporters, following the Charlie Hebdo attacks earlier this year. \n \n By setting up Ghost Security Group, some members of GhostSec have deliberately distanced themselves from Anonymous and its legacy of hooded figures and Guy Fawkes masks. The goal in shedding the outlaw image is to get government counter terrorism officials to pay more attention to the data they are collecting on ISIS and other terror groups. \n \n The effort is paying off, Smith claimed. In July 2015, Ghost Security Group handed over information to federal authorities that was used to disrupt a plan to attack Jews and British citizens in Tunisia. \n \n Since September, Smith has acted as an intermediary between Ghost Security and the government, supplying official with information on the Islamic State\u2019s use of certain communications platforms that are more difficult to monitor than Twitter or Facebook. \n \n \"Data collected by Ghost Security Group and passed to law enforcement and intelligence professionals by me has added value to counterterrorism operations,\" Smith said, pointing to an article in Foreign Policy before the Paris terror attacks in which former Gen. David Petraeus is quoted as saying information provided by organizations like Ghost Security Group could be of value to government. \n \n Governments have been overwhelmed by the Islamic State's prolific use of Internet technologies to coordinate jihadist activities, in the West in the Middle East and North Africa. So there's plenty of room for outside support, Smith said. \n \n \"However, any activities which are not coordinated with government officials who possess the authority to go out and make arrests, or direct other actions against the Islamic State can inadvertently serve to benefit the enemy.\" ||||| The Islamic State militant group (ISIS) released a statement on Monday responding to Anonymous\u2019s declaration of \u201ctotal war,\u201d calling the hacker group \u201cidiots\u201d and offering guidance to pro-ISIS supporters to protect against cyber attacks. \n \n Anonymous threatened that it would launch its \u201cbiggest operation ever\u201d against ISIS in response to the wave of shooting and suicide bomb attacks in Paris that left at least 129 people dead. \n \n The \u201cIslamic Cyber Army\u201d posted a response to Anonymous\u2019s video release on its purported official channel on the privacy app Telegram, giving a series of tips to ISIS supporters. The post was shared by Anonymous-affiliated accounts on social media, such as the group\u2019s Venezuelan arm. Jihadi monitoring network SITE Intelligence also confirmed the post. \n \n \u201cThe Anonymous hackers threatened in new video release that they will carry out a major hack operation on the Islamic State (idiots),\u201d ISIS\u2019s post read. \u201cWhat they gonna hack...all they can do is hacking twitter accounts, emails etc\u2026\u201d \n \n The militant group then listed a series of steps that its supporters should follow online, including not opening suspicious links, changing their locations using workaround technology on their phones and computers, avoiding contact with unknown people on their phone and computers and to renaming their email addresses. \n \n The post says: \u201cDo not talk to to people u don\u2019t know on telegram and block them if u have to cause there are many glitches in telegram and they can hack you by it.

Get prepared,\" a masked figure warned the group in the video. \n \n \"The French people are stronger than you and will come out of this atrocity even stronger,\u201d the figure added. \u201cAnonymous from all over the world will hunt you down. You should know that we will find you and we will not let you go.\u201d \n \n The hacker said that the infamous group will use its cyber skills to \"unite humanity\" and said that terrorists should \"expect massive cyber attacks.\" \n \n Anonymous has targeted ISIS for a number of months following the attacks on the Paris offices of satirical magazine Charlie Hebdo and its hack of U.S. CENTCOM's Twitter account. The group has uncovered the Twitter accounts of ISIS members and hacked a number of the group's sites. \n \n The hacktivist group has dismantled at least 149 of ISIS\u2019s affiliated websites, flagged approximately 101,000 Twitter accounts and nearly 6,000 propaganda videos, U.S. magazine Foreign Policy estimates. \n \n This story has been updated to clarify that the targeting of ISIS by Anonymous followed ISIS's attacks on Charlie Hebdo and U.S. CENTCOM's Twitter account.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Anonymous is following through with its promise to target ISIS in a cyber war after the Paris terror attacks. Operating under the hashtags #opISIS and #opParis, the group has begun leaking the personal details of alleged ISIS recruiters, reports the Independent. Anonymous also has compiled lists of social media accounts linked to extremists in an attempt to have them removed, and at least one post reveals the physical address of a suspected recruiter in Europe. Another list, spotted by Tech Insider, includes more than 80 names, though the site notes that Anonymous has wrongly identified extremists before. The group is also working to take down ISIS-affiliated websites using denial-of-service attacks to overload servers. ISIS, however, seems unperturbed. \"All they can do is hacking (sic) Twitter accounts, emails etc.,\" the terrorist group said in a statement Monday, calling Anonymous a bunch of \"idiots.\" Still, ISIS shared tips with supporters about how to avoid cyberattacks, including altering email addresses, changing a computer's shared location, and ignoring suspicious links, per Newsweek. While Anonymous' attacks could hinder communications between ISIS supporters, analysts tell the Christian Science Monitor that they're unlikely to do much good. \"What they are doing is more of simple harassment,\" one says. \"In the end it is not going to help law enforcement to prevent an actual physical attack like what happened in Paris.\" (ISIS has a 24-hour help desk for jihadis having tech trouble.)"

        "Summary": "Researchers found 2.7-million-year-old soil beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet at Summit using the GISP2 ice core, archived in Denver. Paul Bierman led the study, revealing Greenland's verdant tundra past. The soil's age was determined using beryllium-10 dating, involving cosmic rays. The ice sheet's stability is due to cold-based glaciers, unlike erosive warm-based glaciers. Co-author Dylan Rood highlighted the implications for climate change and sea level rise, showing the ice sheet's endurance over millions of years.",
        "Document": "Buried thousands of feet under Summit, the highest point on Greenland's ice sheet, is a soil born before humans ever walked on Earth. The 2.7-million-year-old silt is a remnant of the verdant tundra that covered Greenland before it was entombed in ice, researchers report today (April 17) in the journal Science. \n \n Pollen and plant DNA buried in the seafloor offshore of Greenland also suggest the island once had tundra and patchy forest, similar to today's high Arctic. The new findings hint that at Summit, the tundra landscape was open to the sky for 200,000 years to 1 million years before ice covered it. [In Photos: See Greenland's Ancient Landscape] \n \n \"There was a really stable landscape on Greenland before the ice sheet came,\" said lead study author Paul Bierman, a geomorphologist at the University of Vermont. \"This landscape has been preserved from beyond the dawn of humankind.\" \n \n The new results also mean the Greenland Ice Sheet gets a nod for endurance. If the soil under Summit has been buried for 2.7 million years, then the discovery implies the ice sheet has never fully melted, even when the Earth went through an incredible natural warming swing 130,000 years ago \u2014 one as warm as this century's predicted climate change. \n \n \"Now we know that it's unlikely the ice sheet has disappeared for significant periods of time in the last 3 million years, at least at this one pinprick on this big island,\" Bierman told Live Science. \"Now human activity may spell the end of it.\" \n \n New look at old ice \n \n The ancient soil was pulled from beneath the Greenland Ice Sheet in 1993, during the GISP2 deep-drilling project to reach the bedrock beneath Summit. The 10,019-foot-long (3,052 meters) GISP2 ice core records more than 100,000 years of past climate history, but until now, no one had examined the dirt in the ice at the bottom of the drill hole. (The ice is archived at the National Ice Core Laboratory in Denver, Colo.) \n \n \"I was asking a really different question than people who look at ice cores,\" Bierman said. \"I was looking for a history of landscapes in ancient Greenland, and that mindset wasn't there 20 years ago. It's the evolution of science \u2014 you're always coming up with new hypotheses to test,\" he said. \n \n Piece of the GISP2 ice core showing silt and sand embedded in ice. Soon after this picture was taken, the ice was crushed in the University of Vermont clean lab and the sediment was isolated for analysis. Credit: Paul Bierman, University of Vermont \n \n Bierman and his co-authors teased out the sediment locked in the frozen ice, and deciphered its history with a well-established geochemical technique called beryllium-10 dating. \n \n Beryllium-10 is a radioactive isotope produced by cosmic rays (high-energy particles that rain down on Earth from space). The beryllium-10 isotopes help researchers gauge the age of landscapes, because the isotopes only form in rocks and soil exposed at the surface; cosmic rays can't penetrate thick ice or deeply buried rocks. Counting the number of beryllium-10 isotopes gives an estimate of how much time a rock or soil spent at the surface, bombarded by cosmic rays. \n \n Bierman said he was stunned by the sky-high levels of beryllium-10 in the soil from the GISP2 ice core. \n \n \"Our eyes just lit up. It was completely unexpected and one of the few times I've been totally surprised in my career,\" Bierman said. \n \n The frozen soil contains millions of beryllium-10 atoms, at a level comparable to other long-lived Arctic landscapes, such as tundra soil in Alaska, the researchers said. Only the interiors of Africa and Australia contain older landscapes, having escaped the erosive power of the Earth's recent ice ages. Soils in these hot continental interiors are many millions of years old. \n \n Basal ice, part of the Greenland Ice Sheet Credit: Paul Bierman, University of Vermont \n \n Persistence of land \n \n Of course, that begs the question of why Greenland's glaciers didn't grind away the ancient soil. The answer: Mounting evidence suggests many ice sheets are frozen to their beds. The ice does flow, but it deforms like glass or warm plastic above a base that is stuck to the ground. In the GISP2 ice core, the bottom 30 to 50 feet (10 to 15 m) is frozen to bedrock, and the ice above is a whirl of folded, deformed layers, Bierman said. These deforming ice sheets are called cold-based glaciers, while those that erode their rocky bottoms with water and ice are known as warm-based glaciers. [The Power of Ice: Photos of Glacier Erosion] \n \n Previous work by Bierman's students found that some Greenland glaciers protect the land like armor, preserving landscapes that were 800,000 years old. \n \n Bierman and his colleagues are now searching for ancient landscapes in Antarctica, though the researchers must reach back further in time because the continent froze earlier than Greenland. \n \n \"The bottom of an ice sheet can preserve some really old landscapes,\" Bierman said. \n \n Email Becky Oskin or follow her @beckyoskin.

How did big ice sheets melt and grow in response to changes in temperature?\" \n \n Findings suggest that even during the warmest periods of history, the ice sheet at the centre of Greenland remained frozen, meaning the land has stayed hidden and unchanged for millions of years. \n \n \"[It's] a refrigerator that's preserved this antique landscape,\" Bierman said. \n \n Scientists take huge interest in the stability of the Greenland ice sheet as it will fundamentally influence sea level rises resulting from manmade climate change. Instead of eroding the land beneath, the sheet has been frozen to the ground, the authors said. \n \n The scientists tested 17 ice samples from the lowest 40ft of the ice core extracted from the glacier in 1993. From the sediment, the researchers extracted a rare form of the element beryllium. \n \n This element is formed by cosmic rays and falls from the sky and becomes stuck to soil and rock. The longer the soil is exposed, the more beryllium-10 it accumulates, meaning it acts as a geological clock. \n \n At first the team was only expecting to find eroded soil, they wrote: \"We thought we were going looking for a needle in haystack. It turned out that we found an elephant in a haystack.\" \n \n The beryllium concentrations could only have been found in soils that have developed over hundreds of thousands of years, if not millions: \"The soil had been stable and exposed at the surface for somewhere between 200,000 and one million years before being covered by ice,\" said Ben Crosby, a member of the research team from Idaho State University. \n \n Rood added: \"Greenland really was green! However, it was millions of years ago. Greenland looked like the green Alaskan tundra, before it was covered by the second largest body of ice on Earth.\"",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 The soil under the highest point of the Greenland Ice Sheet, scientists have learned, is 2.7 million years old, LiveScience reports. In other words, the silt buried under thousands of feet of ice \"has been preserved from beyond the dawn of humankind,\" says Paul Bierman, who determined the soil's age through a geochemical dating process. The findings also suggest Greenland wasn't always as frosty as it is today: Instead, it was a tundra for between 200,000 and one million years before it was encased in ice. It was once home to bits of forest, the scientists found using offshore plant DNA. In other words, as the International Business Times has it, \"Greenland really was green.\" The Greenland Ice Sheet that's there now, however, has been remarkably durable: The findings imply that it made it through a strong period of warming some 130,000 years ago. \"It's unlikely the ice sheet has disappeared for significant periods of time in the last three million years, at least at this one pinprick on this big island,\" Bierman says. \"Now human activity may spell the end of it.\" (What else lies under Greenland's ice? A canyon that dwarfs the Grand Canyon, an aquifer holding 100 billion tons of water, and two huge lakes.)"

        "Document": "(CNN) -- For nearly two weeks, Tamerlan Tsarnaev's body lay unclaimed at the Boston medical examiner's office. A funeral home now has the remains and a quest is underway to find him a resting place in Massachusetts. \n \n But first, he will undergo a second \"independent\" autopsy demanded by his relatives, a family spokeswoman said. \n \n Other hurdles remain. \n \n His death certificate has yet to be filed with the Boston city clerk, and there is no burial plot yet, according to the funeral home holding the remains. \n \n If no grave site is found after the second autopsy, Peter Stefan, the owner of the funeral home, plans to ask the government to find a grave. \n \n Three cemeteries that Stefan contacted said they feared reprisals, but the funeral home owner said you can't pick and choose when it comes to a burial. \n \n \"This is what we do in a civilized society, regardless of the circumstances,\" Stefan said. \"As I told some of them, at the immediate moment you may fear (reprisal), but later on, when things calm down, people are going to resent you because you didn't do it.\" \n \n Tsarnaev died on April 19 after he and his brother shot a university police officer to death, carjacked an SUV and hurled bombs at officers pursuing them, according to authorities. \n \n A few days earlier -- April 15 -- he and his younger brother, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, allegedly bombed the Boston Marathon, killing three and wounding more than 260. \n \n CNN obtained a copy of Tamerlan Tsarnaev 's death certificate, which lists the cause of death as \"gunshot wounds of torso and extremities\" and \"blunt trauma to head and torso.\" \n \n The document notes that Tsarnaev was shot by police and run over and dragged by a car. It lists the manner of death as homicide, and denotes that he was \"DOA,\" or dead on arrival. \n \n Authorities have said his younger brother may have run him over as they resisted arrest days after the marathon attacks. \n \n Separately, 12 people remained hospitalized with bombing-related injuries on Saturday, according to a count by CNN. None were in serious condition. \n \n Also, the frantic manhunt two weeks ago for the surviving bombing suspect drew the attention of gun rights advocates at their convention in Houston. \n \n National Rifle Association Executive Vice President Wayne LaPierre said residents were \"imprisoned\" in their homes with no means to protect themselves while police searched for the younger Tsarnaev. \n \n \"How many Bostonians wished they had a gun two weeks ago?\" he asked. \n \n \"Boston proves it. When brave law enforcement officers did their job in that city so courageously, good guys with guns stopped terrorists with guns,\" he said. \n \n 'Everyone deserves to be buried' \n \n Tsarnaev's body remained unclaimed until Thursday, when an uncle, who had previously publicly condemned his alleged attacks, had a funeral parlor pick up the body. \n \n The uncle, Maryland resident Ruslan Tsarni, had decried the alleged bombers as \"losers\" after the attacks. \n \n Their parents in Dagestan have said they will not fly his body back to Russia for burial, spokeswoman Heda Saratova said. \n \n CNN affiliate WCVB reported that the hearse that picked up Tsarnaev's body ferried it to a funeral home 30 miles away from Boston, near the Rhode Island state line. \n \n Residents of North Attleboro, Massachusetts, took to the streets to boo Tsarnaev, when they heard about the presence of the corpse in their town, The Sun Chronicle reported. \n \n Others took to social media to vent anger at the funeral home for accepting the body. It was later transported to Stefan's funeral home, Graham Putnam & Mahoney Funeral Parlors in Worcester. \n \n \"Everyone deserves to be buried,\" he said. \n \n The marathon bombings \n \n Authorities say the brothers carried out the Boston Marathon bombings using explosive devices made of pressure cookers. \n \n Dzhokhar Tsarnaev, 19, is being held at a federal Bureau of Prisons medical facility in Devens, Massachusetts, charged with using a weapon of mass destruction, which carries the death penalty. \n \n He is being treated for gunshot wounds to the head, neck, legs and hands that he received in the shootout with police that led to his brother's death. \n \n Investigators found explosives residue in the apartment that the elder Tsarnaev shared with his wife and young daughter, a source briefed on the investigation said Friday. \n \n It has turned up in at least three places at the small apartment in Cambridge, Massachusetts, the source said: the kitchen table, the kitchen sink and the bathtub. \n \n Dzhokhar Tsarnaev has said they built the bombs there, U.S. law enforcement officials briefed on the progress of the investigation said. \n \n Other target, a cover-up \n \n The marathon was not the original target, the officials said. The brothers had set their sights on a suicide attack on the city's massive Independence Day celebration, which draws about 500,000 people and is televised nationally. \n \n But the bombs were ready sooner than anticipated and a day or two before the Boston Marathon, they changed their plans, the officials said. \n \n They spoke on the condition that their names not be used because they were not authorized to discuss the matter with the media. \n \n One key question involves whether intelligence, law enforcement and homeland security agencies could have done more in their investigation of Tamerlan Tsarnaev in recent years before the attack and whether they shared information effectively enough. An independent government review is underway. \n \n In an interview with Univision published on its website on Saturday, President Barack Obama said cooperation among agencies can always get better. But he again defended U.S. efforts. \n \n \"I think we can continue to improve and refine how we're engaging and countering terrorist activity,\" Obama said. \"I don't think it's fair to say though that law enforcement dropped the ball.\" \n \n It is very difficult to prevent attacks when dealing with individuals who are self-radicalized and not part of a massive conspiracy or network, he said about the current belief of investigators looking at the origins of the Boston bombing. \n \n Tsarnaev's widow, Katherine Russell, has remained largely out of view since her husband's death, staying in her parents' Rhode Island home. \n \n Her attorney, Amato DeLuca, says the 24-year-old knew nothing about plans to bomb the race, and reports of her husband's involvement came as an \"absolute shock\" to Russell and her family. \n \n Three of Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's friends have been accused of covering for the bombing suspects. \n \n Azamat Tazhayakov and Dias Kadyrbayev, both from Kazakhstan, were charged Wednesday with conspiring to discard potentially incriminating items from Dzhokhar Tsarnaev's dorm room. Robel Phillipos, a U.S. citizen, was charged with making false statements to investigators. \n \n All three are accused of removing items from Tsarnaev's dorm room after the bombings. According to FBI affidavits released this week, they left with the backpack and Vaseline -- which Tazhayakov believed could be used to make bombs -- and Tsarnaev's laptop. \n \n Investigators found the backpack, fireworks and Vaseline in a landfill last week after a two-day search. \n \n The laptop was turned over by Kadyrbayev on April 19, the same day the FBI raided the apartment he shared with Tazhayakov, Kadyrbayev's attorney Robert Stahl said. \n \n The FBI is examining the laptop, two federal law enforcement officials told CNN. \n \n Authorities have said they believe the Tsarnaev brothers acted alone, but are investigating whether they could have learned from or have been aided by terror groups, including groups overseas. \n \n CNN's Chelsea J.

Follow her at Twitter.com/kjbender. ||||| UPDATE, 9:10 p.m.: The person who committed suicide today at the Berkeley City Club was an 80-year-old woman who killed herself in her room using sodium azide, according to the Oakland Tribune. The woman lived in an apartment on the third floor of the landmark building, police officer Ethell Wilson said. The Tribune also reported that the woman left a note warning authorities of the dangerous situation. Sodium azide, a colorless salt, is the gas-forming component in many car airbag systems. When mixed with water it is acutely toxic. \n \n Despite this report, it is unclear, however, how, or if, the woman was affiliated with the Berkeley City Club. In an email to its members sent out just before 9 p.m., the club said \u201cno Member, resident nor team members were involved nor in harm\u2019s way.\u201d \n \n ORIGINAL STORY: Berkeley Police are investigating a suicide that appears to have involved a potentially hazardous material at the Berkeley City Club on Durant Avenue. \n \n According to Berkeley Police Sgt. Joe Okies, three agencies \u2014 Berkeley Police, Berkeley Fire and the University of California Police Department \u2014 have been working in unison since around 2 p.m. today to remove the suspicious material before the coroner could come on scene. \n \n Okies could not say what the suspicious material was, or provide details about the deceased person, while the investigation was ongoing. \n \n Berkeley City Club, at 2315 Durant Ave., between Ellsworth and Dana streets, has been evacuated and all traffic and pedestrians are being forced to take detours from the 2300 block of Durant. AC Transit buses have also been diverted. \n \n The call about \u201ca person down\u201d came in at 1:56 p.m., Okies said. \u201cEmergency services responded and discovered what appeared to be a suicide involving hazardous materials,\u201d he said. \u201cThere was a coordinated effort to remove the material.\u201d \n \n At 6:30 p.m the coroner was not yet on scene. The joint command was taking steps to make the building safe. \n \n \u201cThe known quantity of what appeared to be a hazardous material has been removed,\u201d Okies said. He confirmed the suicide took place inside the Berkeley City Club, but said he could not be more specific. \n \n The death investigation was ongoing at 6:30 p.m. and the 2300 block of Durant was still closed, due mainly, said Okies, to the large quantity of vehicles and equipment situated there. \n \n Berkeley Fire also responded initially to the incident, according to Deputy Fire Chief Avery Webb. But, he said, \u201cit was determined to be a component that made it a law enforcement situation, so [police] assumed control of the situation.\u201d \n \n The Julia Morgan-designed Berkeley City Club is a hotel and private social club with an indoor swimming pool and a restaurant, as well as a hair salon and meeting spaces. \n \n This story is being updated as new information became available. \n \n Follow Berkeleyside on Twitter and on Facebook where we often break news.

        "Summary": "Samantha Bee, host of TBS's Full Frontal, will host an alternative to the White House Correspondents\u2019 Association (WHCA) Dinner. The idea originated after Election Day, according to Bee and executive producer Jo Miller. The event will be held at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. on April 29 and is expected to be broadcast by Time Warner-owned TBS. Proceeds will go to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Full Frontal has used platforms like Facebook Live and Medium for additional content. White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer and President Donald Trump have strained relations with the press.",
        "Document": "Relations between the White House and the press corps that covers it are arguably at an all-time low under the Trump administration, but Samantha Bee intends to offer a solution. She will host a gala dinner in Washington, D.C. that could serve as an alternative to the annual White House Correspondents\u2019 Association Dinner. \n \n Bee and producers from her TBS satirical-comedy program, \u201cFull Frontal,\u201d will take over Washington\u2019s Willard Hotel on April 29 at the same time the WHCA dinner is slated to take place, and invite journalists and celebrities to attend. During a conference call with reporters Monday, Bee said she expected the Time Warner-owned cable network to broadcast the event, but indicated details were still being worked out. \n \n The idea originated after Election Day said Bee and Jo Miller, the show\u2019s executive producer. Bee and others were trying to come up with something they thought would be fun. \u201cWe are trying to have some joy, trying to capture something for ourselves,\u201d said Bee. \u201cWe never intended for this to take away from the other event,\u201d she said. \n \n With the Trump administration venting regularly about how the press treats it, there has been rising concern about whether the WHCA dinner might actually take place this year. In past years, the event has been criticized as one that renders the media too chummy with a subject of a good part of its coverage. A representative for the WHCA could not be reached for immediate comment. \n \n At the same time, the event regularly generates headlines. Comedians including Seth Meyers and Stephen Colbert have held forth in what is usually a very tough room. In 2016, Larry Wilmore, then host of Comedy Central\u2019s \u201cThe Nightly Show,\u201d raised eyebrows with a monologue that poked fun at CNN correspondents Wolf Blitzer and Don Lemon and made use of a racial epithet. \n \n Bee\u2019s move is novel, to be sure, but by making it, the comedienne is joining a number of late-night hosts who are expanding their role with creative outreach. With TV viewers growing ever more fragmented thanks to the rise of streaming video and mobile devices, hosts like Stephen Colbert and Seth Meyers are devising new methods to stay relevant. Others have mounted similar efforts in the past. Jon Stewart and Stephen Colbert in 2010 organized \u201cThe Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear,\u201d a Washington, D.C. event meant to spoof a Glenn Beck rally, that lured fans of both his \u201cDaily Show\u201d and Colbert\u2019s \u201cColbert Report.\u201d \n \n The pressure to stand out has only grown since that time. In the last few years, late-night comedy has seen the rise of what might be called Johnny Carson\u2019s grandchildren: a wave of successors to Jay Leno and David Letterman who must contend with smaller audiences and the relentless pressure to cultivate a growing legion of fans who watch the programs not when they are on TV, but through clips passed around on YouTube or other sites. \n \n These days, the late-night hosts do things Steve Allen could only consider in a fever dream. Stephen Colbert has inserted new introduction segments into repeats, and his staff recently started a new Twitter feed purporting to be written by disaffected members of his program. Seth Meyers\u2019 \u201cLate Night\u201d will make available the show\u2019s signature segment, \u201cA Closer Look,\u201d on social media hours before a new episode that contains it debuts at 12:30 a.m. Jimmy Fallon has given the nod to having an amusement-park ride inspired by his \u201cTonight Show\u201d launch at NBCUniversal-owned Universal Orlando. \n \n These business aspects had no role in the decision to try to hold the event, Bee said. But producers will try to use the soiree to call attention to journalism, and may invite what Bee said were \u201cunsung journalists\u201d to take part, as well as \u201csuper fans\u201d of the program. All proceeds for the gala, which is being called \u201cNot the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner,\u201d will go to the Committee to Protect Journalists. \u201cObviously, the press is under attack\u201d under the Trump administration, said Bee. \n \n Bee\u2019s staff has tested several intriguing ideas since TBS launched the show last February. \u201cFull Frontal\u201d occasionally publishes humorous bits on Medium; passes around extra segments that never made it to air via social media; and occasionally offers previews of the pre-show process via Facebook Live. \n \n The segment seems tailored to Bee, who offers a take-no-prisoners brand of humor and has not been shy about disagreeing with President Trump\u2019s attitudes and policies. TBS recently renewed the program to run for a second season through 2017. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re really doing this,\u201d said Bee. \u201cThis is not a joke.\u201d ||||| During Barack Obama\u2019s time as President of the United States, eight White House Correspondents\u2019 dinner were held, each featuring famous celebrities both onstage and in the crowd. \n \n Notably, in 2011, Seth Meyers hosted the event, poking fun at Donald Trump\u2019s role in the birther controversy that falsely accused Obama of not being born in the United States. \n \n Come 2017\u2019s event and Trump will once again be mocked, but not as an audience member, instead as President himself. An odd turn of events, that\u2019s for sure. \n \n Whether Trump will go forward with the White House Correspondents\u2019 dinner - which has taken place every year since 1983 - remains unknown, his relationship with the press being strained at best. \n \n Samantha Bee won\u2019t be waiting around to find out what Trump plans to do, deciding to host her own counter-event in Washington on the 29 April - the same day the dinner is currently booked for. \n \n 'Not the White House Correspondents\u2019 Dinner' will take place at the Willard Hotel and will see Bee roast the current President. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019re not trying to supersede it,\u201d she told the New York Times. \u201cWe just want to be there in case something happens - or doesn\u2019t happen - and ensure that we get to properly roast the president.\u201d \n \n The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 9 show all The controversial orders Donald Trump has already issued \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n \n 1/9 Trump and the media White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer takes questions during the daily press briefing Getty Images \n \n 2/9 Trump and the Trans-Pacific Partnership Union leaders applaud US President Donald Trump for signing an executive order withdrawing the US from the Trans-Pacific Partnership negotiations during a meeting in the Roosevelt Room of the White House in Washington DC.

Ms. Bee said that it was not an attempt to comment on or compete with that other, better-known banquet, but a night to include jokes about Mr. Trump that she and like-minded comedians want to make.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 If Donald Trump chooses to roast journalists, celebrities, and politicians at the annual White House Correspondents' Dinner in Washington, DC, this year, it'll be with the knowledge that he's being brutally mocked not too far away. Samantha Bee of TBS' Full Frontal says she'll host celebrities, journalists, and comedians at a Trump roast at the Willard Hotel in Washington on April 29. Bee tells the New York Times that the goal of the event, dubbed \"Not the White House Correspondents' Dinner,\" is not to \"supersede\" the official dinner scheduled for the same night, but simply to \"ensure that we get to properly roast the president.\" She promises \"plenty of surprises,\" per Variety. \"If you're not careful you just might learn something. Specifically, you'll learn how screwed we'd be without a free press,\" she adds. It's not yet clear when or how the event will be broadcast, or even who will attend, but Bee says proceeds will go to the Committee to Protect Journalists. Whether the official Correspondents' dinner will happen is also unclear given Trump's tumultuous relationship with the press, his history with the dinner, and \"his oft-demonstrated thin skin,\" reports the Times. The Independent notes the dinner has been an annual occurrence since 1983."

The big break came when they figured out the letter C, and the rest fell into place.

Thomas had been scheduled to face trial in the case beginning Dec. 10. \n \n \"It's a good result based upon the facts of the case,\" said Thomas' court-appointed lawyer, Mark Del Duca, of Pittsburgh. \"I think it's fair for both sides.\" \n \n Sandra Butler, the victim's sister, said she wanted to see Thomas serve more time than the agreed-upon sentence. \n \n \"I feel like she should have 40 or more,\" Butler said. \"She deserved life.\" \n \n Erie police investigators charged that Thomas killed Butler during a March 18 attack at the couple's apartment at 1019 East Ave. Thomas told investigators that she cut Butler in the hand with a folding knife struck him in the head with a table leg during a confrontation. \n \n Thomas also said she placed her head on the couch so a portion of her body would be on Butler's head, police said. Investigators wrote in the affidavit of probable cause that Thomas weighs approximately 300 pounds and Butler weighed approximately 120 pounds. \n \n Butler's death was ruled a homicide \"caused by respiratory insufficiency secondary to blunt force trauma to the neck and thoracic compression, exacerbated by blunt force trauma to the head,\" according to the affidavit. \n \n Police said Butler's body was found on the living room floor at the residence after Thomas called 911 and reported she had killed an individual. \n \n Thomas will remain in the Erie County Prison without bond while she awaits sentencing. \n \n Sandra Butler said her family is still struggling to cope with her brother's death. \n \n \"My mother, she calls for him every night,\" Butler said. \n \n Madeleine O'Neill can be reached at 870-1728 or by email.

Windi Thomas, 44, pleaded guilty to third-degree murder in the March 18 death of Keeno Butler in exchange for a recommended sentence of 18 to 36 years in state prison, the Erie Times-News reports. Police say Thomas admitted crushing Butler after a fight at their Erie residence. She told them she positioned herself so that some of her weight would be on his head. The death was ruled a homicide \"caused by respiratory insufficiency secondary to blunt force trauma to the neck and thoracic compression, exacerbated by blunt force trauma to the head,\" court papers state. Sandra Butler, the victim's sister, says Thomas should have gotten life. \"My mother, she calls for him every night,\" she says.

It won the outstanding variety series Emmy for 10 years in a row. \n \n Stewart, 52, who often emphasized that he is a comedian rather than a news anchor, truly made his mark during the 2000 presidential election with his \u201cIndecision 2000\u201d coverage of the George W. Bush and Al Gore recount in Florida. Afterward, everything on the show clicked, and Stewart emerged as the star of the comedy network \u2014 especially during the Bush administration, when the stentorian and seemingly exasperated host would take on the policies of Bush, vice president Dick Cheney and defense secretary Donald Rumsfeld. \n \n Stewart broke the news of his departure to his audience during the show\u2019s taping in New York. Almost immediately on social media, the tweets started from people who witnessed the announcement. One of them was David Axelrod, a former adviser to President Obama: \n \n Just had the honor of being the great Jon Stewart's guest on @TheDailyShow, where he announced he's leaving. Emotional night. #jonstewart \u2014 David Axelrod (@davidaxelrod) February 11, 2015 \n \n Over the years, Stewart\u2019s team of deadpan \u201ccorrespondents\u201d also became comedy stars, including Stephen Colbert, John Oliver, Steve Carell, Larry Wilmore, Ed Helms, Samantha Bee and Jason Jones. Colbert went on to star on \u201cThe Colbert Report\u201d for nearly a decade before departing in December to take over for late-night veteran David Letterman on CBS. \n \n [Jon Stewart\u2019s hardest truth \u2013 The time has come to wrap up the joke] \n \n \u201cThe Daily Show\u2019s\u201d steady rise coincided with the popularity of Internet video, as clips from Stewart\u2019s broadcast frequently circulated on the Web the following day. They often featured him mocking the 24-hour cable news cycle, and he became known for taking aim at Fox News Channel and CNN. As such, Stewart became a serious pundit in his own right \u2014 albeit one who amply punctuated his commentary with expletives. \n \n \u201cJon has been at the heart of Comedy Central, championing and nurturing the best talent in the industry, in front of and behind the camera,\u201d the network said in a statement Tuesday. \u201cThrough his unique voice and vision, \u2018The Daily Show\u2019 has become a cultural touchstone for millions of fans and an unparalleled platform for political comedy that will endure for years to come.\u201d \n \n A darling of liberals, Stewart made headlines for his ongoing self-proclaimed \u201cfeud\u201d with Fox News\u2019s Bill O\u2019Reilly, which culminated in a live debate called \u201cThe Rumble in the Air-Conditioned Auditorium\u201d in 2012. \n \n Stewart\u2019s impact could also be measured off-screen. His 2010 Rally to Restore Sanity and/or Fear in Washington brought hundreds of thousands to the Mall to see Stewart and his fellow Comedy Central star Colbert take the stage and encourage people to participate in politics and civil discourse despite the seemingly hopeless partisan gridlock in Washington. \n \n [Act Four: Pop culture needs Jon Stewart now more than ever] \n \n As for \u201cThe Daily Show,\u201d some suspected that Stewart\u2019s departure appeared imminent last summer when he took three months off to direct a feature film, \u201cRosewater,\u201d about journalist Maziar Bahari\u2019s imprisonment in Iran. \n \n In an interview with The Washington Post in November, Stewart wouldn\u2019t discuss future career plans other than joking that they included \u201ca nap.\u201d He also dismissed the suggestion that he would run for political office, and laughingly shot down the idea that people \u2014 even those who see him as a trusted figure \u2014 would vote for him. \n \n \u201cYou don\u2019t know that,\u201d he said, \u201cexcept in the way that people would vote for a second-string quarterback to take over for the first-string quarterback if they are feeling frustration at their team\u2019s goals.\u201d \n \n The specific timing of Stewart\u2019s departure was not announced. The network statement said only that the host would leave \u201clater this year.\u201d His contract expires in the fall. \n \n Losing a marquee host is a tough loss for Comedy Central, though the statement made sure to note that the program \u2014 which regularly attracts about a million viewers a night \u2014 \u201cwill endure for years to come.\u201d \n \n It is the latest in a long line of changes in the Comedy Central late-night lineup. Besides Colbert\u2019s departure, John Oliver \u2014 who at one point appeared to be Stewart\u2019s likely successor \u2014 also left last year to host the breakout hit \u201cLast Week Tonight\u201d on HBO. Larry Wilmore, also a potential hosting option as a \u201cDaily Show\u201d standout, recently started his own \u201cNightly Show\u201d on the network, replacing Colbert. \n \n [Why Jon Stewart and Brian Williams should just switch jobs] \n \n Here\u2019s Comedy Central\u2019s full statement: \n \n RELATED \n \n Video: Late-night laughs ||||| On Media Blog Archives Select Date\u2026 December, 2015 November, 2015 October, 2015 September, 2015 August, 2015 July, 2015 June, 2015 May, 2015 April, 2015 March, 2015 February, 2015 January, 2015 \n \n Jon Stewart leaving \n \n Jon Stewart, host of Comedy Central's \"The Daily Show,\" will step down later this year, the president of the network confirmed in a statement to the On Media blog Tuesday. \n \n \u201cFor the better part of the last two decades, I have had the incredible honor and privilege of working with Jon Stewart.

        "Document": "February 14, 2011 11:53 am ET by Simon Maloy \n \n First Lady Michelle Obama is in the midst of a nationwide anti-obesity campaign aimed at shrinking America's collectively expanding waistline. The conservative media are striking back against Mrs. Obama's message of fitness and nutrition by decrying what they see as government intrusion into our pantries. \n \n At least, that's what they're doing when they're not calling Michelle Obama fat. \n \n Rush Limbaugh's long been laying the groundwork for this sexist attack, using stories about the First Lady's nutrition programs to call the fitness-fanatic Mrs. Obama \"Michelle, My Butt.\" (The jab's lack of sense it exceeded only by its lack of self-awareness.) \n \n Yesterday, the resident cartoonists at Andrew Breitbart's BigGovernment.com posted this offering: \n \n If there's a \"joke\" in there, I'm missing it. Notably, the version of the cartoon online now differs slightly -- but significantly -- from the version that showed up in my RSS reader, in which the First Lady demands: \"Shut up and pass the lard!\" \n \n It's been a long time since I've expected anything approaching comity from the conservative media, but this is the sort of stuff most of us left at the grade school playground. ||||| Conservative provocateur James O'Keefe hasn't done much worth crowing about since he took down ACORN with misleadingly edited secret videotapes. He was feted as a right-wing celebrity. He got arrested for trying to sneak into a senator's office under false pretenses. And then he had his attempted prank of a CNN reporter backfire when the reporter backed out after discovering that he planned to lure her onto a boat and \"seduce\" her. O'Keefe has responded , finally, to this last embarrassment. Unsurprisingly, he has no regrets, and the liberal media is the real guilty party. \n \n O'Keefe's defense -- posted, of course, on Andrew Breitbart's \"Big Government\" -- rests on us believing that the prank-outlining document obtained by CNN was a draft that O'Keefe did not plan on actually following. He says ideas for stunts are sent to him all the time (like a fancy Hollywood producer!) and sometimes he approves of the idea behind a prank without endorsing everything about it. \n \n As you can imagine in our line of work, we get lots of leads, ideas, schemes and \u201cpunked\u201d style plans sent to us all the time. If you were to roam through my personal emails there are many outrageous plans, some parts of which I may approve of in principal with an \u201cI like it\u201d in an email thread. But I may well object to a host of things about the plan, though I like the objective. When the CNN idea was pitched to me, I\u2019ll admit that I liked the basic absurdity of meeting Abbie Boudreau on a boat and the idea of counter-seduction satire executed in a tame, humorous, non-threatening manner. After all, as all liberal reporters do, she was trying to \u201cseduce\u201d (a metaphor) me so she could get more for her story. It would be fun, I thought, to turn the tables in jest. However, I was repulsed by the over-the-top language and symbolism that was suggested in the memo that was sent to me, and never considered that for a moment. \n \n The gross document in question wasn't submitted by a fan. It was drafted by Ben Wetmore, with whom O'Keefe has worked for years. O'Keefe has called Wetmore his mentor. O'Keefe and his attempted phone-tampering buddies crashed at Wetmore's Louisiana house the month of the Landrieu office incident. \n \n The rest of O'Keefe's defense lies in still not understanding why unwanted \"seduction,\" on a boat, under false pretenses, while being secretly filmed, might not just be considered harmless fun. \n \n In my version, the reporter was never going to be placed in a threatening situation. She would have had to consent before being filmed and she was not going to be faux \u201cseduced\u201d unless she wanted to be. If a CNN reporter would be willing to engage in such a folly, it might even be more newsworthy than Rick Sanchez\u2019s firing. (CNN also has Elliot Spitzer on payroll. He\u2019s done more outrageous things than anything I\u2019ve ever gotten in my in-box). The sexually explicit document CNN is now \u201creporting\u201d on was never going to be implemented as written. She saw how I was dressed that day, with my usual blazer and collared shirt. In the document she reported as being \u201cauthentic,\u201d I was supposed to have been dressed with my chest exposed, slicked backed hair, with gold chains. That ought to have been a red flag the document was not a reflection of my true intentions. Ms. Boudreau was never going to be put in the bizarre situations outlined in the document CNN reported. There were no mirrors, sex tapes, blindfolds, fuzzy handcuffs, posters of naked women, or music. Sorry, you were not going to see my face saying the words \u201cBubble Headed Beach Blonde who comes on at 5\u201d into a video camera.

So far at least half a dozen people have been picked up, according to parish officials. Dozens of people on Plaquemines' east bank, south of St. Bernard Parish, reportedly are stranded, some in attics to escape flood waters that may have reached 5 to 9 feet in certain areas. \n \n There are also as many as 65 people on the Belle Chasse/Scarsdale ferry landing in Plaquemines Parish, officials said. A search and rescue operation is underway there. Officials have received reports that the water is a foot from the top of the levee. \n \n There is a nursing home in the Jesuit Bend area on the west bank that was not evacuated, and the Governor's office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness wants to try to evacuate it. \n \n The parish levees on the east bank are about 8.5 feet, though some are as high as 12 feet. Some estimates have storm surge at 13 feet; corps officials this morning put the figure at 12.5 feet. Corps officials are saying that there are no confirmed reports of breaches, which suggest failures in levees. \n \n Story by Benjamin Alexander-Bloch and Rebecca Mowbray Staff writers \n \n The National Guard was to launch a larger rescue effort this morning, coming into the east bank through St. Bernard Parish. After the wind subsides, other water and air rescue efforts will follow. \n \n While federal levees in the area appear to be holding, problems in Plaquemines Parish are occurring in areas not protected by the federal system, which was revamped after Katrina. \n \n Along with the problems at Braithwaite, the levee overtoppings on the east bank are also affecting the Bel Air near White Ditch at River Mile 65. Parish officials have also received calls from a woman at Willspoint on the east bank who is claiming she received 9 feet of water and is in her attic. There are reports that the Woodlawn fire station, between Braithwaite and White Ditch, which received no water during Katrina, has been inundated with 5 feet of water. \n \n Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said he wants to cut a hole in the Mississippi River levee to drain the Braithwaite area. But the Army Corps is opposed to the plan and hopes to get pumps brought to the area. \n \n \"My reaction is big and as many as you've got,\" Col. Edward Fleming, district commander of the Army Corps of Engineers, said of the pumps. \n \n When the storm is over, the distinction between a federal and non-federal levee will become salient, but for now, the Corps is able to help. Corps engineers are working on getting Plaquemines officials a hydrograph of the back of the levees by Jesuit Bend, so they can get a better handle on what they might be dealing with there. \n \n Col. Fleming said Plaquemines officials need to think about getting better pumping capactity down there for future storms. \n \n Guy Laigast, director of Plaquemines Parish's emergency preparedness, said some points may have seen winds of up to 110 mph. \n \n \"The devastation of my house is worse than Katrina and the flooding in Woodlawn is worse than Katrina, so those things tell me that the damage on the east bank is worse than Katrina,\" Plaquemines Parish President Billy Nungesser said this morning. \n \n When the daylight hit, parish officials and others were planning to get out and start examining the parish, \"like fleas,\" said James Madere, a parish GIS analyst who will help assess damage. \n \n Mark Riley, the deputy director of Governor's Office of Homeland Security and Emergency Preparedness who is stationed in Plaquemines this morning, told a Times-Picayune reporter that rescue operations would occur as soon as it was safe. \n \n \"The standard is we don't want to put first responders' lives in jeopardy and until there stops being an immediate threat to their lives we cannot put their lives at risk,\" Riley said. \n \n It appears from current reports that as Isaac moves upward, it might start pushing water out of the east and into the west. Parish officials are now heavily monitoring Barataria Bay, which reportedly raised 2 feet in the last 90 minutes, from about 4:30 a.m. to 6 a.m. \n \n The fear is that water would get pushed into Plaquemines' west bank levees and affect residents in Myrtle Grove and the Jesuit Bend area. While many of the homes along the levee in Myrtle Grove are raised about 14 feet, many of the Jesuit Bend are not as high. ||||| Utility companies say more than 500,000 have lost power as Hurricane Isaac moves through southeast Louisiana, bringing wind, rain and flooding. \n \n Most of the outages Wednesday are in areas around New Orleans as Isaac lashes the area with 80 mph winds. \n \n The Category 1 hurricane has pushed water over a rural levee to flood some homes, knocked out power and immersed beach-front roads in Louisiana and Mississippi as it makes a drenching slog inland from the Gulf of Mexico. \n \n Wind gusts of more than 60 mph and sheets of rain pelted New Orleans, where people braced themselves for the storm behind levees that were strengthened after the much stronger Hurricane Katrina hit seven years ago to the day. ||||| A tornado warning has been issued in southern Mississippi as Hurricane Isaac hits Louisiana and Mississippi with high winds and drenching rains. \n \n The National Weather Service says the tornado warning area Wednesday includes the cities of Long Beach and Gulfport, which are west of Biloxi on Mississippi's Gulf Coast. \n \n The warning comes as Category 1 Isaac moves inland in Louisiana, bringing flooding and power outages after making landfall Tuesday evening. \n \n The U.S. National Hurricane Center warns Isaac's dangerous storm surges and flooding threats from heavy rain are expected to last all day and into the night as it crawls over Louisiana.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Today is the 7th anniversary of Hurricane Katrina, and for residents of Plaquemines Parish, it's deja vu all over again, according to the parish president. Billy Nungesser tells NPR that the parish, located some 95 miles from New Orleans, has already seen damage that rivals, and could even surpass, that heaped upon it by Katrina. With the levee overrun, Nungesser says parts of the parish that had escaped unscathed in previous hurricanes now sit under five feet of water. \"I don't know who's calling this a Category 1, but this is no Category 1,\" Nungesser said. \"My house has more damage than it did during Katrina.\" More on the situation in Plaquemines, and beyond: The parish's levees range from 8.5 feet to 12 feet in height. The Army Corps of Engineers estimates the storm surge hit 12.5 feet, but have yet to confirm a breach. This implies the levees, which are not part of the federal levee system, failed, reports the Times-Picayune. While the director of Plaquemines Parish's emergency preparedness says winds may have hit 110mph, CNN reports that Isaac has weakened a bit since, with maximum sustained winds of 75mph (the hurricane threshold is 74mph). As of about 10:30am ET, Isaac's center was located about 50 miles south-southwest of New Orleans. The AP reports that 500,000 are without power in the areas around New Orleans. In Southern Mississippi, a tornado warning has been issued."

The entire Q&A can be found below. \n \n Apple starts off by stating that it has never tracked, and will never track the location of a customer\u2019s iPhone. The company goes on to say it\u2019s partly to blame for any \u2018confusion\u2019 about it, though, because users haven\u2019t been \u2018educated\u2019 to fully understand the technical issues with providing mobile users with fast and accurate location information. \n \n That said, the company did identify several \u2018bugs\u2019 which it says it will fix shortly. \n \n As we posited earlier, Apple says it\u2019s merely maintaining a crowd-sourced database of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers around your current location that is generated by tens of millions of iPhones sending geo-tagged locations, both anonymously and encrypted. \n \n According to the Cupertino company, the location data that researchers spotted on the iPhone is not the past or present location of the iPhone, but rather the locations of Wi-Fi hotspots and cell towers surrounding the iPhone\u2019s location, which it adds can be more than one hundred miles away from the device in question. \n \n Apple says it simply can not identify the source of this data (i.e. your location). \n \n Nevertheless, the company says it will release a free iOS software update sometime in the next few weeks that reduces the size of the Wi-Fi hotspot and cell tower database cached on the iPhone, start encrypting and refrain from backing up this cache and delete it entirely when Location Services is turned off by the user. \n \n Apple admits that this storing the cache for such a long time was a bug that will be fixed, ultimately recognizing that this was a valid source for concern. Another bug resulted in the iPhone continually updating its Wi-Fi and cell tower data from Apple\u2019s crowd-sourced database even after the user turned off Location Services on his phone. \n \n Earlier this week, a class action suit was filed, accusing Apple of invasion of privacy and computer fraud and of \u201csecretly recording movements of iPhone and iPad users.\u201d \n \n French, German, Italian and South Korean regulators had also started investigating the alleged location collection feature on Apple devices following publication of the researchers report. \n \n Does Apple\u2019s response sound credible to you? \n \n Apple Q&A on Location Data:",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Apple finally responded to the accusations that it was tracking iPhone users\u2019 locations today, saying it \u201chas never done so and has no plans to ever do so.\u201d In a statement, which you can read on TechCrunch, the company explained that it was actually keeping a log not of the phone\u2019s location, but of the location of WiFi hotspots and cell towers, \u201csome of which may be located more than one hundred miles away from your iPhone.\u201d The data is used to more quickly triangulate users\u2019 position when they use location-based services, and is sent to Apple anonymously. But the company did admit to some \u201cbugs\u201d in the software\u2014like that it keeps collecting data even after you\u2019ve turned Location Services off, and that it stored years of data, instead of the week's worth it needs\u2014and promised an iOS update to fix them.

(WISH) \u2014 Investigators analyzed thousands of text messages, emails, pictures and videos to bust Jared Fogle and Russell Taylor.

Officials said the dog found devices in Jared\u2019s house that helped the investigation. \n \n He\u2019s a black dog named Bear, and he\u2019s a lot like any other two-year-old lab.

They knew what Bear was capable of. \n \n To show off Bear\u2019s skills Thursday, Jordan hid electronic devices throughout a room and put Bear to work. In less than ten minutes, the dog found a small memory card in a book bag, a flash drive in a box, and an iPad in a filing cabinet. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s just like any other K-9 training, like with the narcotics or explosives or anything,\u201d Jordan said. \u201cYou get the dog used to the odor and reward them as they indicate on it.\u201d \n \n Bear\u2019s reward is food.

Typically, Carpenter said she was able to get her daughter\u2019s responses under control. \n \n In Honolulu, Paige was \u201clit up,\u201d she was so excited to be in Hawaii. \n \n But about 10 to 15 minutes after swimming in a pool along with her younger sister Violet and a friend, Paige left the water to complain that her nose was burning.

The correct spelling is within the text of this post. ||||| A message from Paige's mom, Karin Carpenter: \n \n I know that you wanted some details about Paige, and the event that took her life. We do not know the exact cause of Paige's reaction and the doctor's and I can only speculate. My thoughts are that it is a combination of many things: 1. the flight, 2. a total change of environment with new allergens that she has never experienced, 3. the huge feral cat population where we were in Hawaii Kai, 4. the pool possibly had pesticide and chemical runoff from the golf course that surrounded the house, 5. One doctor thought she had a bronchial spasm that was similar to drowning due to the temperature of the pool. \n \n \n \n On Thanksgiving day, Thursday, November 27th, Paige, Hank, Violet and I flew to Oahu to spend the holiday with Hank's cousin Simone Perez, along with her husband Henry, son Nico, and mother Maradee. We arrived around 1 p.m. and Paige was so excited to visit Hawaii for the first time. We got our rental car and drove directly to Simone's house in Hawaii Kai to drop off our luggage and get situated in our rooms before heading over to their friends home for a Thanksgiving meal. \n \n \n \n We arrived at Scott and Jen's home (who we just met) for a Thanksgiving dinner. They had many friends, neighbors, and family present and were very welcoming to us. Paige was not able to eat much of what they had prepared due to her extensive food allergies, so she had a big plate of rice and soy sauce. This did not affect her allergies, and she was having a great time. She made friends with one of the girls at the house and they got in the pool/hotub with Violet. Paige seemed okay at first, but then she got out of the water and complained to me that after diving into the water, the nose was stinging really bad. She asked to use her inhaler, which I got for her and after doing a few puffs she said that it didn't work. I told her to wait a moment, to see if it helps and to go towel dry and get dressed. After she did this, she was still wheezy and not breathing clearly so she did a few more puffs. Another guest, who happened to be an EMT was nearby and she got benedryl for Paige, but she was having a hard time taking it. I knew something was not right so I asked our host to call 9-1-1. Paige started to panic because she has never seen me so concerned before and we have never needed to call an ambulance. She looked into my eyes and screamed, and said, \"Mom, I'm dying. I know I am because I can see it in your eyes.\" The ambulance arrived within 7 minutes and they administered a spot of epinephrine and benedryl. I rode in the front seat and we were off to the Kapiolani Children's hospital. It took 27 minutes to get there and at one point I didn't think that Paige survived. The ER doctor was giving the ambulance personnel instructions to care for Paige while in-route, and they were waiting for her outside when we pulled in. Paige was breathing and responsive when we arrived and even complained that the nurse hurt her when she felt a needle. Paige's airways were so tight that they doctor had a hard time putting the breathing tube in, and she suffered cardiac arrest. It took 20+ minutes of CPR before they got Paige's heart started again, and were able to put in the breathing tube. About one hour later, she was ready to go upstairs to the Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. Paige was on life support, and in a coma because of the trauma that her body suffered. The doctors put Paige on a cooling blanket to lower her body temperature to 34 degrees, as studies have indicated that the cold temperatures help to preserve the brain. For the next 72 hours she was kept at that temperature and had a nurse at her bedside at all times. \n \n \n \n My mom flew in on Saturday to be with us and between Hank, my mom Marcha, and myself, there was almost always someone by her side. We only got 1-2 hours of sleep per day, if that and we talked to Paige, prayed, played music, read her messages from friends, read her book, massaged her body, and told her how proud we were of her and how much we loved her. Her biological father, Josh flew in on Sunday and spent a couple hours per day with her until Wednesday. He is so full of guilt for neglecting her for years, that he was not able to stay until the end and say goodbye. \n \n \n \n Paige had her first MRI on Dec 1st and the results showed that most of the areas of her brain had sustained damage, except for the brain stem which was in good shape, and the portion of the brain that affects the memory. The doctor said that the full extent of the damage would be revealed over the next several months, and as Paige came out of her coma. Hank and I were steadfast in the belief that Paige would heal and whatever affliction was caused by this, we would care for her in any way necessary. My main concern and prayer was that whatever handicap that she had, I wanted her to still be able to express herself, have vision, and be able to create art. Because that is what drove Paige, what made her happy and was her absolute talent. The next day, Paige was not doing well. Her vitals were all over the place, she couldn't maintain a body temperature, her blood pressure was inconsistent, and an EEG showed that her brain waves were not very strong. They did an emergency MRI and the findings were shocking. In 24 hours, the damage to Paige's brain was tremendous. She showed major damage to all parts of the brain, including the brain stem which controls basic functions such as breathing, swallowing, and regulating body temperature. On Dec 3rd, Paige's doctors ran the first series of tests to see if her brain was completely dead. Sadly, Paige didn't respond to any of the tests. They stopped her ventilator to test if she would try to breathe on her own, she didn't. On Dec 4th, the doctors ran her final tests, and she was medically pronounced dead at 9:25 a.m. Hank, Violet, my mom and I were able to say goodbye and spent the next 7 hours with her. We were able to hug, hold and touch her without the tubes, ventilator, and IV lines hooked up. \n \n \n \n \n \n Help spread the word! Share Tweet 1.4k total shares total shares",

Jorge Barahona , 53, is charged with felony aggravated child abuse for an alleged attack on his 10-year-old adopted son, identified in local media reports as Victor Vocter.According to a probable cause affidavit filed by West Palm Beach police , Barahona told officers he placed the body of his deceased daughter -- identified by local media as Victor's twin, Nubia -- in the back of his pest-control vehicle early Monday and then drove north on Interstate 95 from his home in Miami to West Palm Beach.\"Jorge told us he was distraught over the death of his daughter and intended to commit suicide,\" the affidavit says. \"Jorge said he pulled over onto a grassy area of the expressway where he would easily be found. He gave [Victor] a handful of sleeping pills and told him to take them so he could sleep.\"Barahona allegedly told police he took a five-gallon gas can he had inside the truck and poured gasoline over his head. His son was beside him in the truck, with his head on Barahona's lap.\"Jorge intended to ignite a lighter to set himself on fire, but he could not do it because [Victor] was present,\" the affidavit says.The police report does not detail how the girl died and does not mention whether Barahona discussed her death with police.The bizarre case began to unfold early Monday , when a Florida Department of Transportation employee discovered Barahona's pickup truck parked on the side of I-95, not far from the Palm Beach Lakes Boulevard exit. When he looked inside the truck, the employee saw Victor seated next to a gas can. The boy was soaked in chemicals and suffering from respiratory distress. An unresponsive Barahona was found on the ground outside the truck.Florida Highway Patrol spokesman Lt. Tim Frith said the occupants had been \"exposed to some type of spilled chemical,\" which investigators have since determined to be an acid-based metal-cleaning solution.A hazardous materials crew was called in to manage the cleanup of the truck. The crew was in the process of moving containers out of the vehicle when they found the young girl's body covered in acid and wrapped in a plastic bag, police said.Barahona remains hospitalized at Columbia Hospital. Victor is hospitalized in the intensive care unit at St. Mary's Medical Center.The boy is suffering from severe burns to his abdomen, upper thighs and buttocks. During an examination, medical staff also discovered prior injuries, including a fractured clavicle, a fractured arm, scarring to his buttocks and lower abdomen, and ligature markings to both wrists, police said.Police said Victor's injuries are not consistent with Barahona's story.\"Jorge incurred no obvious burns to his person unlike injuries suffered by [Victor],\" the affidavit states. \"When confronted about the severity of [Victor's] injuries, Jorge explained some of the gasoline must have splattered on [Victor]. Jorge's account of events is inconsistent with [Victor's] injuries.\"The boy is being kept in a hyperbaric chamber. According to The Associated Press , he has stopped urinating and doctors are having a difficult time treating him because they do not know what kind of chemical agent caused his injuries.Meanwhile, child welfare officials are investigating Barahona and his wife, Carmen Barahona.\"We are in the preliminary stages of a very tragic, complex case, and DCF will be working with all our community partners,\" Florida Department of Children and Families spokesman Mark Riordan told the AP.The Barahonas married in 1996 and reportedly operated CJ's Pest Exterminator Inc. out of their home. Records obtained by The Palm Beach Post show neither had a criminal record in Florida. They reportedly adopted four children, ages 7 to 11, with special needs from foster care.DCF has investigated the Barahonas on three other occasions in the past several years. The previous cases were closed with \"some or no indicators of abuse or neglect,\" the AP reported. According to The Miami Herald , the most recent investigation began on Thursday, four days before Barahona was found on the side of the interstate. The agency reportedly received information from a teacher that Nubia and Victor were being bound by their hands and feet and made to stand in the bathtub, the newspaper reported.Investigators tried to locate the children, but Carmen Barahona told them that she was separated from her husband and that he had custody of them. A report issued later, however, \"implicated\" Carmen Barahona in Nubia's disappearance, the Herald reported.DCF took custody of the two other children on Tuesday.

While examining the boy, doctors noted he had sustained previous injuries, including a broken collarbone, a broken arm, scarring to his buttocks and lower abdomen, and ligature marks on both wrists, police said. \n \n After Barahona and his son were taken to a hospital, a worker decontaminating the truck discovered the body of the girl, wrapped in a plastic bag, the document said. \n \n Barahona told police he was distraught over the death of his daughter, and had intended to commit suicide by dousing himself with gasoline and setting himself afire, the affidavit said. Barahona said he didn't go through with his suicide plan because his son was with him, the document added. \n \n \"Basically, to paraphrase, he was stating that he placed his daughter in a plastic bag being distraught over her death,\" West Palm Beach Police Spokesman Chase Scott told reporters. \"He drove here from South Florida accompanied by his son, Victor. He then pulled off to the side of the road saying that he poured gas on his self, intending to light himself on fire.

        "Document": "This undated photo provided by the U.S. Marshal's office shows Adel Daoud, of Hillside, Ill. Daoud is charged with terrorism for allegedly trying to set off what he thought was a car bomb Sept. 14, 2012, near a downtown Chicago bar. (AP/AP) \n \n Four days before a sweeping government surveillance law was set to expire last year, Sen. Dianne Feinstein, the chairman of the chamber\u2019s Intelligence Committee, took to the Senate floor. She touted the law\u2019s value by listing some of the terrorist attacks it had helped thwart, including \u201ca plot to bomb a downtown Chicago bar\u201d that fall. \n \n \u201cSo I believe the FISA Amendments Act is important,\u201d the California Democrat said before a vote to extend the 2008 law, \u201cand these cases show the program has worked.\u201d \n \n Today, however, the government is refusing to say whether that law was used to develop evidence to charge Adel Daoud, a 19-year-old Chicago man accused of the bomb plot. \n \n And Daoud\u2019s lawyers said in a motion filed Friday that the reason is simple. The government, they said, wants to avoid a constitutional challenge to the law, which governs a National Security Agency surveillance program that has once again become the focus of national debate over its reach into Americans\u2019 private communications. \n \n \u201cWhenever it is good for the government to brag about its success, it speaks loudly and publicly,\u201d lawyers Thomas Durkin and Joshua Herman wrote in their motion. \u201cWhen a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional rights are at stake, however, it quickly and unequivocally clams up under the guise of State Secrets.\u201d \n \n If the government acknowledged that it had used evidence derived from the FISA Amendments Act, Daoud would have standing to challenge the law\u2019s constitutionality. Specifically, Daoud\u2019s lawyers would be able to take on a provision known as Section 702. The law permits the interception of foreign targets\u2019 \u00ade-mails and phone calls without an individual warrant, including when the foreigners are in communication with Americans or legal residents. \n \n The U.S. Supreme Court in February rejected a constitutional challenge to Section 702 by a group of journalists, lawyers and human rights advocates, saying they had no standing to sue because they had not proved that their communications had been intercepted. \n \n But the court also said that if the government intends to use information derived from the Section 702 surveillance in a prosecution \u201cit must provide advance notice of its intent,\u201d and a defendant may challenge the lawfulness of the surveillance. The government assured the court that it would give such notice to criminal defendants. \n \n In a filing this month in Chicago, U.S. Attorney Gary S. Shapiro refused to say whether the evidence was obtained under Section 702. Instead, he said, the government told Daoud the evidence was acquired pursuant to a traditional FISA court order, rather than under the expanded surveillance program authorized in 2008. A traditional order requires the government to go to a FISA judge and show probable cause that the target is an agent of a foreign power. \n \n Daoud\u2019s attorneys say in their pleading that the government is being disingenuous. \u201cWe believe it is clear that the evidence . . . came from Section 702,\u201d Durkin said in an interview. \u201cEither Senator Feinstein\u2019s information was correct in December 2012, or she was given wrong information. The government has never disputed what she said.\u201d \n \n A spokesman for the U.S. attorney\u2019s office had no comment but noted that the office had replied to Daoud\u2019s initial request for notice earlier this month in Shapiro\u2019s filing. \n \n \u201cThe most troubling part of the case is the government seems to be trying to hide the ball,\u201d said Alex Abdo, a staff attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union, which argued the Supreme Court case on behalf of the journalists, lawyers and activists. \u201cThey told the Supreme Court not to worry about reviewing the FISA Amendments Act because it would get reviewed in a criminal case. They said if they used the evidence in a criminal case, they\u2019d give notice. Now they\u2019re telling criminal defendants they don\u2019t have to tell them. It\u2019s a game of three-card monte with the privacy rights of millions of Americans.\u201d \n \n Abdo said the original FISA statute, passed in 1978, requires the government to notify defendants when evidence being used against them is derived from surveillance authorized by the law. The court, he said, should require the government to abide by the law. \u201cOtherwise,\u201d he said, \u201cthe most sweeping surveillance program ever enacted by Congress will never be reviewed in public by a court.\u201d \n \n Similarly, Stephen I. Vladeck, a law professor at American University, said, \u201cEveryone knows the role that Section 702 is playing in a case like this.\u201d But, he said, \u201cthanks in part to the Supreme Court, the government can use Section 702 and then never have to defend its constitutionality.\u201d \n \n The central problem with Section 702, critics say, is its breadth and lack of individual warrants. The law targets non-U.S. persons \u201creasonably believed\u201d to be located outside the United States but does not require that the government obtain a warrant before intercepting communications. \n \n Moreover, the purpose of the collection is \u201cforeign intelligence,\u201d a broad category that may include everything from information on terrorism to nuclear proliferation to what a European journalist is writing on human rights abuses or an African businessman is saying about global financial risk, experts say. \n \n According to a criminal complaint filed by an FBI agent, Daoud received an e-mail in February 2012 regarding his registration with an online jihadi forum overseas. In May 2012, Daoud sent himself a link for nine issues of Inspire magazine, an online publication put out by al-Qaeda in the Arabian Peninsula, an al-Qaeda affiliate. \n \n That same month, two FBI undercover employees posing as jihadists contacted Daoud online in response to material he had posted. Between July and September, an undercover FBI agent met Daoud in Chicago and helped him plan the attack. \n \n Daoud was arrested in September after he attempted to detonate a bomb placed in a jeep outside a Chicago bar with a remote-triggering device. \n \n Durkin said that he thought the FBI used surveillance powers under Section 702 to identify Daoud and then got a traditional FISA order to conduct its sting against him. \n \n \u201cNonetheless,\u201d he said in the motion Friday, \u201cthe government\u2019s interest in confusing these two issues is obvious. If it can avoid giving proper notice to defendants, as it seeks to do here, the government can avoid a challenge to the [FISA Amendments Act] altogether.\u201d \n \n U.S. District Judge Sharon Johnson Coleman has set a trial date for February. ||||| Lawyers in Chicago terror case question what sparked investigation \n \n Attorneys for Adel Daoud wrote that prosecutors are purposely hiding information to avoid a possible battle over the constitutionality of the secret spying program, which was authorized by Congress in 2008 under an amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. \n \n Lawyers for a west suburban teenager charged with plotting to set off a bomb outside a downtown Chicago bar accused prosecutors Friday of dodging questions about whether the investigation was sparked by a massive government surveillance program. \n \n From left, Defense attorney Thomas Durkin and father of the defendant Adel Daoud, speak with members of the press before attending a hearing for Daoud at the Dirksen U.S. Courthouse on Sept. 17, 2012. (Armando L. Sanchez ) \n \n Daoud's attorney, Thomas Anthony Durkin, said he is asking only for a yes or no on whether evidence in his case was derived from the expanded law, not for the highly classified content or details of the searches. \n \n Prosecutors wrote in an earlier filing that they have no obligation to disclose the information unless ordered by the judge presiding over Daoud's case. \n \n The surveillance programs \u2014 including one that collects U.S. phone records and another that tracks Internet use by foreigners with possible links to terrorism \u2014 were exposed earlier this month by Edward Snowden, a former National Security Agency contractor who leaked details to news organizations. \n \n In the ensuing uproar, government officials have defended the programs as a highly effective weapon against terrorism. Testifying before the House Intelligence Committee earlier this week, an FBI official said Internet surveillance was pivotal in the arrest of Najibullah Zazi in 2009 for plotting to bomb a New York subway. \n \n The filing by Daoud's attorney scolded the government for trying to have it both ways. \n \n \"Whenever it is good for the government to brag about its success, it speaks loudly and publicly,\" Durkin wrote. \"When a criminal defendant's constitutional rights are at stake, however, it quickly and unequivocally clams up under the guise of state secrets.\" \n \n Daoud, 19, of Hillside, came under FBI scrutiny after posting messages online about killing Americans, authorities have said. FBI analysts posing as terrorists exchanged messages with him and ultimately helped him plan an attack. Daoud was arrested in September after being accused of trying to detonate what he thought was a powerful car bomb outside a bar in the Loop. \n \n Daoud, who has pleaded not guilty, is set to go on trial in February in federal court in Chicago. \n \n jmeisner@tribune.com",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Adel Daoud is a Chicago 19-year-old accused by the feds of trying to detonate a bomb outside a Chicago bar in 2012. His case, however, could serve as the first constitutional challenge to the government's sweeping surveillance techniques, reports the Washington Post. In a court filing yesterday, attorneys for the terror suspect demanded to know whether federal authorities used their expanded powers under a 2008 amendment to the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act to nab him. \u201cWhenever it is good for the government to brag about its success, it speaks loudly and publicly,\u201d they wrote, as per the Chicago Tribune. \"When a criminal defendant\u2019s constitutional rights are at stake, however, it quickly and unequivocally clams up under the guise of State Secrets.\u201d Federal prosecutors say they're not obligated to say whether they used the law, and a judge will have the final say, reports WLS-TV. So did they use it? Here's a hint: Last year, when the Senate was debating whether to renew the 2008 law\u2014it's formally known as the FISA Amendments Act\u2014Dianne Feinstein made her case in favor by asserting that it had helped stop \"a plot to bomb a downtown Chicago bar.\" If the judge rules that the government must acknowledge it used the FAA, Daoud's attorney's would then be able to challenge its constitutionality."

        "Summary": "A study in Psychological Science by the University of Rochester explores how emotions affect color perception. Researchers found that sadness impairs the ability to distinguish desaturated colors along the blue-yellow axis but not the red-green axis. Participants watched video clips, including a sad scene from The Lion King where Mufasa dies, to induce emotions like sadness, amusement, and neutral emotion, then completed a color perception test. The study suggests that dopamine, a neurotransmitter, may play a role in this phenomenon.",

Moreover, the prevalence of linguistic pairings between emotions and color words suggests that emotional experience and color perception may be linked. The purpose of the present research was to test whether emotion influences color perception. We did this by experimentally manipulating emotion with video clips in two experiments (specifically, sadness and amusement in Experiment 1, and sadness and neutral emotion in Experiment 2) and measuring color perception (specifically, accuracy in identifying desaturated colors). The results of both experiments showed that sadness impaired color perception along the blue-yellow color axis but not along the red-green color axis. ||||| TIME Health For more, visit TIME Health \n \n The world seems dreary, gloomy and gray when you\u2019re feeling blue. In fact, being down in the dumps might even affect how you perceive the color blue. \n \n A recent study published in the journal Psychological Science shows a direct connection between a person\u2019s ability to perceive color and their emotions. \n \n \u201cColor is such an important part of our experience,\u201d says lead author Christopher Thorstenson, a psychologist at the University of Rochester. There\u2019s a reason, he says, that common descriptive phrases of the world include \u201ccolorless,\u201d \u201cgray,\u201d and \u201cfeeling blue\u201d by sad people, and \u201cbright\u201d and \u201ccolorful\u201d by happier folks. \n \n MORE: This May Be Why You\u2019re Seeing The Dress As White and Gold \n \n Psychologists have long known that emotions have a direct influence on what is called \u201clow-level visual processes,\u201d or simple perceptions of space and form. That\u2019s because your visual processes require some chemical input from your brain that might affect how you process what you see. Sadness decreases arousal, for example, which in turn limits the amount of light entering the retina and reduces your visual acumen. A gloomy mood lowers dopamine, which may impair neutrotransmitters in the retina. And depression has been linked to a deficit in the ability to differentiate colors, meaning the world might be viewed as a fuzzier, less vivid place for some people feeling sad. \n \n In the experiment, the researchers randomly assigned people to one of two groups. Those who were assigned \u201csadness\u201d watched a sad film clip: a particularly heart-wrenching scene from The Lion King. Those in the \u201camusement\u201d group were shown a standup skit. Everyone was then asked to look at red, yellow, green and blue patches that had been desaturated of color and muted to gray. \u201cSome of the patches are pretty difficult [to discern],\u201d Thorstenson admits, saying that it often takes a bit of intent staring to figure out their shade. People were scored on how accurate their color perception was, and they then completed an emotional evaluation. Another part of the study had people watch a neutral desktop screensaver and perform the same tasks. \n \n The result: sad people had a hard time differentiating between shades along the blue-yellow color axis. Intriguingly, however, people who were sad did not have problems seeing colors in the red-green spectrum\u2014possibly because of an evolutionary need to see red as an anger response, Thorstenson speculates. (\u201cSeeing red\u201d, therefore, might also be a more literal phrase than we once thought.) \n \n The fact that Thorstenson and his team only saw differences in color perception along the blue-yellow axis means that this isn\u2019t just a fluke, he explains. Had sadness simply reduced chemical arousal or engagement, the results would probably have indicated that color perception across all spectrums were affected, but that wasn\u2019t the case. It also highlights the possible importance of dopamine in sight, something researchers are hoping to focus on more in the future. \u201cWe know dopamine is important in mood disorders like depression and ADHD, but there might be something going on with how dopamine affects how we see colors, too,\u201d Thorstenson says. \n \n \u201cHow we feel can really influence how we see the world around us,\u201d he says. ||||| \u201cFeeling blue\u201d might be more than just a metaphor. \n \n Indeed, how we feel about the world can play a huge role in how we see it, according to a new study in the journal Psychological Science. Feeling sad can keep us from seeing in certain colors, as though we live in Dorothy\u2019s Kansas. But a good mood can bring those colors back into the world, just like a tornado trip to Oz. \n \n \u201cWe were already deeply familiar with how often people use color terms to describe common phenomena, like mood, even when these concepts seem unrelated,\u201d the study\u2019s lead author Christopher Thorstenson said in a statement for the Association for Psychological Science. \u201cWe thought that maybe a reason these metaphors emerge was because there really was a connection between mood and perceiving colors in a different way.\u201d \n \n Thorstenson was right. All it took was a clip from a cartoon to make people start seeing differently. \n \n Participants in the study, which took place at the University of Rochester in New York, were invited to watch the two-minute scene from \u201cThe Lion King\u201d in which Mufasa is killed. To the mournful strains of Elton John\u2019s score, they watched Simba\u2019s eyes widen and fill with tears as he nuzzled against his fallen father. The clip, which apparently is often used in psychology studies, is scientifically proven to induce irresistible sadness at the plight of the orphaned lion cub. \n \n Others participants were shown a clip from a stand-up comedy routine or a neutral screen saver. \n \n Once they felt sufficiently gloomy, cheerful or completely unmoved, depending on which clip they saw, the participants were put to the test. Each was presented with a series of washed-out color swatches, so de-saturated they were nearly gray, and asked to identify what color they were. \n \n While the amused and neutral groups\u2019 ability to discern colors remained unaffected, the Disney-watching crowd had trouble distinguishing swatches on the blue-yellow axis. (The eye\u2019s color encoding matrix ranks light on two axes \u2014 from red to green and from blue to yellow \u2014 and then sorts it into what we recognize as color.) \n \n \n \n The image on the left show normal color saturation. The image on the right has been altered by de-saturating the yellow and blue colors in the image. (iStock) \n \n That only blue-yellow perception was affected, and only among the sad group, is significant. \n \n Psychologists believe that perception along the blue-yellow axis is linked to the neurotransmitter dopamine, Thorstenson told the Association for Psychological Science. Dopamine is the chemical signal that transmits information from neuron to neuron, stimulating the pleasure and reward centers of the brain. It\u2019s responsible for the flush of excitement an addict feels at the sight of a drug and the thrill of an explorer ascending a mountain for the first time, and its absence is associated with apathy, lack of motivation and hopelessness. \n \n Thorstenson\u2019s study suggests that sadness affects dopamine\u2019s other tasks \u2014 among them, transmitting visual information about blue and yellow light. A similar phenomenon has been found in patients with ADHD, who have low dopamine levels and sometimes struggle to perceive the color blue. \n \n But the study\u2019s findings go beyond color. \n \n They\u2019re a reminder that our experience of the world is not as immediate and objective as we\u2019d like to believe. It\u2019s easy to assume that cognition \u2014 what we think and feel \u2014 is a rational response to perception, that we intake information from our senses, process it, and then draw conclusions from that data. \n \n But some psychologists believe that our understanding of the world happens \u201ctop-down\u201d as much as \u201cbottom-up.\u201d In other words, higher-level cognition can determine what and how we perceive. Rather than seeing the world as it really is, our perceptions are colored \u2014 literally \u2014 by emotions and expectations. \n \n But this notion is debated \u2014 a recent study from Yale argued that many studies purporting to show a \u201ctop-down\u201d effect are flawed. \n \n \u201cThe possibility of top-down effects on perception is tremendously exciting,\u201d the study\u2019s author\u2019s wrote. \u201cAccordingly, though, the bar for a suitably compelling top-down effect should be high. Until this high bar is met, it will remain eminently plausible that there are no top-down effects of cognition on perception.\u201d \n \n Still, findings like Thorstenson\u2019s pop up a lot, and in his conversation with the Association for Psychological Science he was convinced. \n \n \u201cOur results show that mood and emotion can affect how we see the world around us,\u201d he said. ||||| Are you feeling blue or do you have a case of the mean reds? A new University of Rochester study suggests our ability to perceive color may indeed be flavored by our moods. In two experiments, people who felt sad performed worse on a color accuracy test than those who felt either amused or neutral. \n \n \"Data are beginning to emerge supporting the conventional wisdom that people\u2019s emotions influence how colorful the world looks to them,\" wrote the researchers in their conclusion. \n \n If recent data is to be believed, color may influence cognition and behavior, say the researchers. Experiments have shown \"exposure to the color red can subsequently impair performance on challenging cognitive tasks, elevate the perceived attractiveness and health of faces, and reduce food intake,\" they wrote. Exploring in a similar vein, this team of University of Rochester researchers performed two distinct experiments. \n \n The first began with 129 college students, 83 female, watching either a sad or amusing film clip. After watching the clips, participants were tested for how they were feeling. As expected, those who had watched the sad clip reported more sad feelings, while those who had watched the funny clip experienced greater amusement. Next, the research team tested the participants on color perception accuracy. \n \n Here, the participants viewed 24 separate color patches created in Adobe Photoshop on a computer screen. For each patch, participants indicated whether the color patch was red, yellow, green, or blue. Participants saw each color patch twice, for a total of 48 random trials. \n \n The results from this first experiment indicated sad participants performed worse on a color-perception task than amused participants, yet this was only true for colors along the blue-yellow axis. Along the red-green axis, the tested mood states of participants didn't influence perception accuracy. \n \n Color wheel Michael Hernandez, CC by 2.0 \n \n Because the results could not indicate whether sadness impaired color perception (or whether amusement enhanced it), the researchers decided to run a second experiment. This time, they roughly followed the guidelines of the first experiment, except instead of half the participants seeing an amusing film clip, they watched a neutral clip. Importantly, the researchers converted all the film clips to gray scale \"to control for any possible color-fatigue effect that might have been caused by the films' own colors,\" they noted. \n \n Following the clips, the participants were tested on both emotional state and color perception. Compared to those who\u2019d watched the neutral clip, sad participants were less accurate in perceiving color along the blue-yellow axis, though equally accurate along the red-green axis. \n \n \"We are speculating that dopamine deficiency might influence [perception of blue-yellow] colors, because past research has shown that perception of these colors is affected in clinical disorders in which dopamine plays a role,\" Dr. Christopher A. Thorstenson, department of clinical and social sciences in psychology, told Medical Daily in an email. \"It is very important to note that we did not measure dopamine, and so cannot say if this is the case.\" \n \n Source: Thorstenson CA, Pazda AD, Elliot AJ.

        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Got the blues? You probably aren't seeing blues clearly. That's the takeaway from a new study that finds how a person views the color blue may actually depend on mood, reports Medical Daily. Not all colors were affected in the same way. Researchers at the University of Rochester asked 129 college students to watch either a stand-up comedy clip or the scene from The Lion King in which Mufasa dies, then recorded the participants' moods, per the Washington Post. Next, participants took a color accuracy test in which they had to look at 48 color patches that had been desaturated to look nearly gray, then identify whether each was red, yellow, green, or blue. People who were feeling down in the dumps performed worse than those who were amused. In other words, the data supports \"the conventional wisdom that people's emotions influence how colorful the world looks to them,\" the researchers say. However, the sad group performed poorly only when quizzed about colors on what researchers call the blue-yellow axis. They could identify colors on the red-green axis just as well as others\u2014perhaps due to the evolutionary need to see red as a sign of anger, reports Time. The results are \"a reminder that our experience of the world is not as immediate and objective as we\u2019d like to believe,\" observes the Post. Researchers suggest a sad mood messes up the ability of the neuron transmitter dopamine to process information about blue-yellow colors. (This woman sees 100 times more colors than you.)"

Each strap is held in place by long straps that close with fabric fasteners, not buckles. Riders hold ropes inside the raft. \n \n Riders are weighed to ensure each raft carries between 400 pounds and 550 pounds. \n \n States' regulations of waterslides and other amusement rides have faced scrutiny following Caleb's death.

        "Summary": "Alexander Klotz re-evaluated the gravity tunnel problem, traditionally 42 minutes, using the Preliminary Reference Earth Model and seismic data. He found the actual time is 38 minutes, considering varying density. The shell theorem and harmonic motion are key in traditional calculations. Published in the American Journal of Physics, Klotz's study, praised by Dickinson College's David Jackson, shows the outer core's impact and the effectiveness of a constant-force approximation. Klotz engages in educational outreach.",
        "Document": "Suppose you dug a tunnel through the center of Earth, jumped in, and let gravity pull you through. How long would it take you to reach the other side of the planet? For decades, physics students have been asked to calculate that time and have been taught that the correct answer is 42 minutes. Now, a more realistic analysis has lopped 4 minutes off that estimate. \n \n \"This is the kind of paper we love,\" says David Jackson, a physicist at Dickinson College in Carlisle, Pennsylvania, and editor of the American Journal of Physics, a publication of the American Association of Physics Teachers. The new calculation, which appears in the March issue of the journal, doesn't merely add more detail about the structure of Earth, he notes. It also explains why you can replace one overly simple assumption with another equally crude one and still get a much more accurate answer. \"That's what makes this so much fun to think about,\" Jackson says. \n \n The gravity tunnel problem is a staple of introductory physics courses because it simultaneously demonstrates both striking features of Isaac Newton's law of gravity and a common but very important type of cyclical motion. To solve it, students must calculate how the force of gravity on an object changes as the thing falls through the tunnel. \n \n Here's where the usual unrealistic assumption enters. Students assume that, like a billiard ball, Earth has the same density throughout: roughly 5500 kilograms per cubic meter. In that case, the strength of the gravitational force pulling you toward Earth's center varies in proportion to the distance from the center. That's because as you descend through the tunnel, the amount of mass at an altitude lower than yours decreases, whereas the mass at an altitude higher than yours no longer has any effect on you\u2014as students calculate using a bit of mathematics called the shell theorem. \n \n Because the force pulling you toward the center is proportional to the distance from the center, you zip back and forth through Earth exactly as a weight on a spring bobs up or down or a pendulum swings back and forth. The gravity tunnel problem is used in teaching precisely because it produces such simple harmonic motion. \n \n In reality, of course, Earth does not have a uniform density, but has a less dense crust and mantle and a more dense core. So Alexander Klotz, a graduate student in physics at McGill University in Montreal, Canada, started thinking about what a more realistic analysis would yield. Klotz says he isn't sure why he started mulling over the problem. But he sometimes answers physics questions on the website reddit. \"I've sort of engaged in a bit of educational outreach,\" Klotz says, \"and that [question] comes up quite a lot.\" \n \n To get a more realistic mass distribution for Earth, he relied on the Preliminary Reference Earth Model, which is based on seismic data. It traces Earth's density from about less than 1000 kilograms per cubic meter at the surface to roughly 13,000 kilograms per cubic meter at the center of the core 6371 kilometers below, including a dramatic jump at the edge of the outer core, 3500 kilometers from the center. Solving the problem numerically, Klotz found that an object should fall through Earth in 38 minutes and 11 seconds, instead of the 42 minutes and 12 seconds predicted assuming a uniform planet. \n \n Curiously, Klotz found that he got almost exactly the same answer\u201438 minutes flat\u2014if he simply assumed that the force of gravity remained constant and equal to the value at the surface as an object plummeted toward the center. Such a constant force would require a different density distribution, one that increases steadily as the distance to Earth\u2019s center falls\u2014so that when the distance to the center is halved, the density doubles\u2014and peaks to infinity at the center. (The real distribution simply plateaus in the core, and the force of gravity diminishes to zero at the center of the core.) \n \n So why does the constant-force approximation work so well? Because of the mass distribution in Earth, the force of gravity remains roughly constant\u2014and actually increases slightly\u2014down to the outer core, Klotz explains. From there on in, the force of gravity falls with distance much as in the original problem. But by that point, the object is moving so fast that it actually spends very little time passing through the core, where the constant-force approximation is obviously wrong. So in the end, the approximation is good enough. \n \n It's that surprising explanation that makes the new analysis gratifying, Jackson says. \"The classic problem needs to stay,\" he says. \"But this is a nice addition to the classic problem.\" For his part, Klotz says that, in this day of big science, his experience shows that \"with the right idea it's still possible to make, not a monumental discovery, but an incremental one.\" ||||| Abstract \n \n This paper examines the gravity tunnel using the internal structure of Earth as ascertained from seismic data. Numerically, it is found that the time taken to fall along the diameter is 38 min, compared to 42 min for a planet with uniform density. The time taken to fall along a straight line between any two points is no longer independent of distance but interpolates between 42 min for short trips and 38 min for long trips. The brachistochrone path (minimizing the time between any two points) is similar in shape to the uniform-density solution but tends to reach a greater maximum depth and takes less time to traverse. Although the assumption of uniform density works well in many cases, the simpler assumption of a constant gravitational field serves as a better approximation to the true results. ||||| A composite image of the Western hemisphere of the Earth. Credit: NASA (Phys.org)\u2014Alexander Klotz a student at McGill University in Canada has calculated a new answer to the commonly asked physics question, how long would it take a person to fall all the way through the Earth? Instead of the commonly accepted 42 minutes, he claims it is 38. He has published his reasoning, math and conclusions in a paper published in The American Journal of Physics. \n \n If someone were to drill a hole all the way through the planet, and then somehow manage to fall into it, how long would it take them to arrive on the other side? That is a physics question put to students every year, and those who give it expect the answer to be 42 minutes. But is that answer correct? Klotz says no and has the math to prove it, Science reported. \n \n The accepted answer of 42 minutes takes into account the constantly changing impact that gravity will have (and ignoring drag due to the presence of air) on the person falling, becoming less and less of a factor as the center of the Earth is approached then growing stronger and stronger as the person heads \"up\" against gravity on the other side. It is accepted that the speed attained during the descent on the first half of the journey would be significant enough to cause the person to continue moving against gravity on the other side of the planet, right up until the surface is reached. \n \n But Klotz argues that it is time to start taking the different densities of the Earth's layers into consideration\u2014after all, a lot of research has shown that our planet is a lot denser at the center than at the crust for example\u2014and that of course would have an impact on the person falling through. He has used seismic data to calculate the different densities at different depths and has used that data to give a more accurate answer to the falling man question, stating that it would in fact, take just 38 minutes (and 11 seconds) to fall all the way through, not 42 and (12 seconds). \n \n Interestingly, Klotz also notes that if gravity were to be assumed to be at a surface level constant throughout the duration of the trip, the math shows it would take just 38 minutes as well. \n \n Explore further: Are astronauts really weightless? \n \n More information: The gravity tunnel in a non-uniform Earth, Am. J. Phys. 83, 231 (2015); dx.doi.org/10.1119/1.4898780 . On Arxiv: arxiv.org/abs/1308.1342 \n \n Abstract \n \n This paper examines the gravity tunnel using the internal structure of Earth as ascertained from seismic data. Numerically, it is found that the time taken to fall along the diameter is 38 min, compared to 42 min for a planet with uniform density. The time taken to fall along a straight line between any two points is no longer independent of distance but interpolates between 42 min for short trips and 38 min for long trips. The brachistochrone path (minimizing the time between any two points) is similar in shape to the uniform-density solution but tends to reach a greater maximum depth and takes less time to traverse. Although the assumption of uniform density works well in many cases, the simpler assumption of a constant gravitational field serves as a better approximation to the true results. \n \n",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 It's a common hypothetical in physics classrooms: How long would it take to fall through a tunnel from one side of the Earth to the other? The new answer: 38 minutes and 11 seconds, reports Science. The result is courtesy of McGill University graduate student Alexander Klotz, whose calculations take four minutes off the previously accepted answer and appear in the American Journal of Physics. The reason for the shorter time? Unlike previous calculations, Klotz's take into account that the Earth's layers have different densities, and those differences would affect the hypothetical falling man, notes Phys.org. \"The way the Earth is structured, the gravity increases slightly as you go deeper towards the dense core, to about 110% of its surface value, before getting weaker as you move through the core, reaching zero at the center,\u201d says Klotz, as quoted in Forbes. (If it's all a little too hypothetical, try physics-inspired pasta instead.)"

Huntsman Jr. joked about their heated exchanges. The debate, sponsored by Fox News and Google, highlighted tensions as they vied for conservative support. Rick Santorum, Michele Bachmann, Herman Cain, Newt Gingrich, Ron Paul, and Gary Johnson also participated, with Romney criticizing Perry's stance on in-state tuition for illegal immigrants, while Perry defended his position.",
        "Document": "ORLANDO, Fla. \u2014 In their third debate in as many weeks, former Gov. Mitt Romney of Massachusetts and Gov. Rick Perry of Texas engaged in a sometimes heated back and forth over immigration , health care and entitlements, their rivalry dominating a stage that included seven other candidates struggling to catch up in the race for the Republican presidential nomination. \n \n Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry arrived here with a strategic imperative to challenge the other\u2019s consistency and conservative credentials. The tensions only grew as the night wore on, to the point where Jon M. Huntsman Jr., the former governor of Utah, joked that Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry were at risk of bludgeoning each other to death. \n \n Still, after two hours of dueling it was unclear whether Mr. Perry had achieved his goal of knocking Mr. Romney off his fairly unruffled stride. It was similarly not certain that Mr. Romney had made headway in knocking Mr. Perry down a few pegs from what has been a relatively strong opening to his young campaign. \n \n Mr. Romney sought to capitalize on the concern among many conservatives about Mr. Perry\u2019s position on illegal immigration, harshly criticizing the Texas policy that allows illegal immigrants to qualify for in-state tuition rates at public colleges and universities. \n \n \u201cThat just doesn\u2019t make sense to me,\u201d Mr. Romney said, noting that illegal immigrants get as much as $22,000 a year in tuition breaks that out-of-state citizens do not get. \n \n Offering an impassioned defense of that policy \u2014 and receiving boos from a segment of the audience \u2014 Mr. Perry did not back down, saying, \u201cIf you say that we should not educate children that have come into our state for no other reason than they\u2019ve been brought here by no fault of their own, I don\u2019t think you have a heart.\u201d \n \n The debate, held at the Orange County Convention Center and sponsored by Fox News, Google and the Republican Party of Florida, featured robust audience participation and questions submitted via YouTube. The 5,000 people there responded loudly at times, including boos during a question from a gay solider about the repeal of the \u201cdon\u2019t ask, don\u2019t tell\u201d policy regarding gay and lesbian service members. \n \n And while the Fox News moderators sought to engage all of the candidates, the exchanges between Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry \u2014 standing side by side \u2014 overshadowed the others. \n \n At one point, Mr. Romney cited a passage from Mr. Perry\u2019s book \u201cFed Up!\u201d and said the Texas governor had suggested that state or local governments be allowed to run their own Social Security programs. He accused Mr. Perry of running away from his own words. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s a Rick Perry out there that\u2019s saying the federal government shouldn\u2019t be in the pension business,\u201d Mr. Romney said. \u201cYou better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that.\u201d \n \n Mr. Perry hit back by accusing Mr. Romney of editing his book \u201cNo Apologies\u201d between printings to remove a passage saying that the health care plan he instituted in Massachusetts \u2014 considered a model for President Obama\u2019s overhaul \u2014 was good for the nation. \n \n \u201cYou said that it was exactly what the American people needed to have \u2014 that\u2019s Romneycare \u2014 given to them as you had in Massachusetts,\u201d he said. \n \n Mr. Romney responded by saying: \u201cI actually wrote my book, and in my book I said no such thing. And it\u2019s fine for you to retreat from your own words in your own book, but please don\u2019t try and make me retreat from the words that I wrote in my book.\u201d \n \n As the exchange continued, Mr. Perry, standing to Mr. Romney\u2019s right, joked, \u201cIt\u2019s kind of badminton\u201d and swung his arm. But later he set any joking aside, saying of Mr. Romney, \u201cI think Americans don\u2019t know sometimes which Mitt Romney they\u2019re dealing with.\u201d \n \n Mr. Romney had managed to emerge relatively unharmed from the past few debates, and the pressure was on Mr. Perry to change that. If Mr. Perry\u2019s key line was meant to be a solid punch to the jaw, he seemed to rush it and stumble a bit. \n \n \u201cIs it the Mitt Romney that was on the side of \u2014 against the Second Amendment before he was for the Second Amendment? Was it \u2014 was before \u2014 he was before the social programs from the standpoint of \u2014 he was for standing up for Roe v. Wade before he was against first \u2014 Roe v. Wade?\u201d he said. \u201cI mean we\u2019ll wait until tomorrow to see which Mitt Romney we\u2019re really talking to tonight.\u201d \n \n A late attempt at humor seemed to go astray as well, when Mr. Perry was asked which of the candidates on stage he would pick as his vice-presidential nominee. Speaking of Herman Cain, a former business executive, Mr. Perry said he would \u201cmate him up\u201d with the former House Speaker Newt Gingrich to make a perfect political partner. Mock wincing, Mr. Romney remarked coolly that the night had produced \u201ca couple of images I\u2019m going to have a hard time getting out of my mind.\u201d \n \n Mr. Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China in the Obama administration, appeared to express frustration that the night had been so much about Mr. Romney and Mr. Perry. He noted that four years ago the two supposed Republican front-runners were former Mayor Rudolph W. Giuliani of New York and former Senator Fred Thompson of Tennessee. \n \n \u201cThey seemed to disappear altogether,\u201d he said. \u201cI can\u2019t remember where they went.\u201d ||||| ORLANDO \u2014 The Republican presidential field strayed away from the central 2012 topic of jobs Thursday night to wage a pitched debate over a pair of far more explosive issues: immigration and Social Security. \n \n In the Orlando debate\u2019s most dramatic clash, Rick Perry defended himself from a multi-front attack on his immigration record, struggling to fend off rivals he called heartless for their attitude towards the children of undocumented immigrants. \n \n Text Size - \n \n + \n \n reset Perry defends immigration policy POLITICO 44 \n \n Three of Perry\u2019s opponents \u2013 including his nearest competitor, Mitt Romney \u2013 accused the Texas governor of coddling illegal immigrants with a law allowing young people who broke the law by entering the United States to claim in-state tuition benefits in Texas. \n \n \u201cThat kind of magnet draws people into this country to get that education,\u201d Romney charged. \u201cWe have to turn off the magnet of extraordinary government benefits.\u201d \n \n Under fire from Rick Santorum and Michele Bachmann on the same issue, Perry said he didn\u2019t believe in punishing children who entered the country illegally through no fault of their own. \n \n To candidates who disagree, Perry said: \u201cI don\u2019t think they have a heart.\u201d \n \n \u201cWe need to be educating these children because they will become a drag on our society,\u201d Perry said, drawing boos from the audience. \n \n The immigration exchange was a rare debate moment that put the staunchly conservative Perry on the defensive by attacks from the right. \n \n But it was not the only moment in the evening where Perry appeared unsteady or unfocused in his performance. \n \n Though the Texan has rocketed to a high single-digit lead in most 2012 primary polling, Perry has yet to hand in a commanding debate appearance, and on Thursday gave a conspicuously meandering answer on foreign policy that will reinforce questions about his preparedness as a candidate. \n \n In general, the debate hosted by Fox News, Google and the Republican Party of Florida followed a familiar script: Perry and Romney attacked each others\u2019 views on Social Security, everybody beat up on the Obama administration and most of the candidates faded into the background. \n \n In addition to Perry, Romney, Bachmann and Santorum, there were five other candidates on stage: Herman Cain, Ron Paul, Jon Huntsman, Newt Gingrich and Gary Johnson, the former New Mexico governor making his first debate appearance in months. \n \n For much of the first hour, the debate was a fairly humdrum affair, showcasing an array of high-tech bells and whistles offered by Google, which co-sponsored the debate. \n \n The first set of questions came from viewers who submitted their questions on YouTube, and largely allowed the candidates to recite talking points without being challenged by moderators. \n \n And Fox took time away from the candidate forum to share results from instant polls of the debate viewers, who answered questions such as: How much does someone need to make before they are considered rich? ||||| Side by side in confrontational debate, Republican presidential hopefuls Mitt Romney and Rick Perry sarcastically accused each other Thursday night of flip-flopping on Social Security and health care, flashpoints in their intense struggle for the party nomination. \n \n Republican presidential candidates Texas Gov.

Mitt Romney points to the audience with Rep. Michele Bachmann, R-Minn, prior to a debate Thursday, Sept. 22, 2011, in Orlando, Fla. (AP Photo/Phelan... (Associated Press) \n \n In a debate that focused on character and credibility as much as other issues, Perry insisted he had backed off \"not one inch, Sir\" from what he had written in a campaign-season book published a few months ago. \n \n Romney vouched for his own steadfastness moments later. \"There are a lot of reasons not to elect me,\" he said. \"There are a lot of reasons not to elect other people on this stage. ... But one reason to elect me is I know what I stand for. I've written it down. Words have meaning.\" \n \n The two men assailed one another in the third debate in as many weeks in a race for the Republican presidential nomination growing testier by the day. \n \n Perry runs ahead in national opinion polls, with Romney a close second, and they compete daily for endorsements from members of Congress and other party luminaries in hopes of gaining a permanent edge before the caucuses and primaries begin early next year. \n \n The other contenders on the stage struggled at times to gain the debate spotlight, even as they struggle to gain traction in the polls. \n \n The GOP presidential hopefuls all agreed quickly on one point _ that President Barack Obama's handling of the economy was woeful. They said they would cut taxes, eliminate government regulations and take other steps to help create jobs in a nation with 9.1 percent unemployment. \n \n Yet the two-hour event was marked by clashes over Social Security, health care, immigration, gun rights and more. \n \n Romney accused Perry of having said the federal government \"shouldn't be in the pension business, that it's unconstitutional,\" a reference to Social Security benefits. \n \n Noting his rival's denials, Romney mocked him. \"You better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that,\" he said. \n \n Perry soon returned the favor, saying that Romney switched his position on health care between editions of a book he had published. In one edition, Perry said, Romney advocated expanding to the rest of the country the health care program he signed in Massachusetts. \"Then in your paperback you took that line out, so speaking of not getting it straight in your book, Sir.\" \n \n \"It's like badminton,\" said Perry. \n \n The Massachusetts legislation required residents of the state to purchase health coverage or pay a fine, a cornerstone of the law that Obama won from Congress last year that has inflamed conservative voters across the country. \n \n Perry also accused Romney of flip-flopping his views on the rights of gun owners. \n \n In fact, both Perry and Romney have sought to blur if not rewrite portions of their own records as they vie for the nomination. \n \n In Romney's case, that has meant trying to win support from conservative voters despite the moderate positions he held on social issues while he was governor of Massachusetts. \n \n And for Perry, it has meant trying to fend off criticism that his views on Social Security and other issues do not render him unelectable. \n \n Perry gave no ground on one issue _ his support for a state law in Texas that gives the children of illegal immigrants reduced tuition to state colleges and universities. \n \n \"If you say that we should not educate children who have come into the state for no other reason than they've been brought there, by no fault of their own, I don't think you have a heart,\" he said. \n \n That drew a retort from former Pennsylvania Sen. Rick Santorum. \"No one is suggesting that students who are illegal in this country shouldn't go to colleges and universities,\" he said, adding that he objects to giving them state subsidies to do so. \n \n \"Most folks have to pay the full boat. ... Why should they be given preferential treatment as an illegal in this country?\" he said. \n \n There was relatively little jockeying on the economy. \n \n \"The president's party wants to take from some people and give to others. That isn't the way to lift America,\" said Romney. \n \n Perry said his state ranked first in the country five years in the row in attracting businesses looking to relocate. \"Something special happened there ... and we plan to keep it that way,\" he said. \n \n Rep. Michele Bachmann of Minnesota told one questioner, \"You should get to keep every dollar you earn,\" then backpedaled. \"Obviously we have to give money back to the government so we can run the government,\" she said. \n \n The two-hour event was sponsored by Fox News and Google, in keeping with an emerging trend in which mainstream media organizations partner with Internet companies . \n \n Without saying so, former House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave an endorsement of sorts to one of the elements of Obama's job proposals. Asked whether he would renew unemployment benefits for those out of work, he said they should be required to participate in a \"business led\" job training program. \"I believe it is fundamentally wrong to give people money for 99 weeks for doing nothing.\" He added. \n \n Obama has called for Congress to extend the current system of unemployment benefits, but he also wants to permit states to experiment with the type of training program that has been used in Gingrich's home state of Georgia. \n \n Also on stage were Rep. Ron Paul of Texas, former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson, businessman Herman Cain and former Utah Gov. Jon Huntsman.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Republicans got back into debate mode tonight, with Rick Perry and Mitt Romney trading a series of sharp and sometimes sarcastic barbs at one another over Social Security, immigration, and other issues, reports AP. No fewer than nine candidates were on the stage, thanks to the invite extended to former New Mexico Gov. Gary Johnson. (He got perhaps the biggest applause line of the night with this line: \"My neighbor's two dogs have created more shovel-ready projects for this country\" than Obama.) But Perry and Romney were the main focus, and their back-and-forth on Social Security typified things: Perry said his position on it isn't as radical as his foes say, adding it was \"not the first time that Mitt's been wrong on some issues before,\" notes the New York Times. Romney responded: \"There's a Rick Perry out there that's saying the federal government shouldn't be in the pension business. You better find that Rick Perry and get him to stop saying that.\" Perry then accused Romney of changing views of his Massachusetts health care law in different versions of his book, and later widened the flip-flopping charges to a host of other issues. (Romney used the phrase \"nice try\" at different times to deflect Perry criticisms.) Immigration also emerged as a main issue, with Romney, Michele Bachmann, and Rick Santorum criticizing the Texas policy of giving in-state tuition benefits to immigrants' kids, notes Politico. Bachmann called such programs \"magnets,\" but Perry said of his critics, \"I don't think you have a heart.\" Catch up with live-blogging and details on the other candidates here."

Tim Bishop (D-N.Y.), speaks on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C. Andrews announced Tuesday that he is resigning from Congress after 23 years. (J. Scott Applewhite/AP) \n \n In his 23 years in Congress, Rep. Robert E. Andrews (D-N.J.) has written 646 different pieces of legislation. That is a vast array of bills, covering a vast number of subjects: children\u2019s pajamas, relations with Taiwan, commemorative coins and trade duties on licorice. \n \n But all of Andrews\u2019s bills had one thing in common. \n \n They didn\u2019t become law. \n \n Only four of Andrews\u2019s hundreds of bills have ever passed the House of Representatives. But none of them passed the Senate, so none made it to the president\u2019s desk. \n \n Even in Congress, where the vast majority of bills fail, that is an unusually awful batting average. By those numbers, Andrews would be America\u2019s least successful lawmaker of the past two decades. \n \n Andrews, 56, said Tuesday he would resign in two weeks, taking a position at the law firm Dilworth Paxson. In an interview Tuesday, he insisted that these statistics don\u2019t capture his true record in Congress. \n \n The reason, he said, is that the classic idea of how lawmaking works \u2014 an idea becomes a bill, the bill gets a debate, and the debate ends with a vote \u2014 does not mean much on today\u2019s Capitol Hill. \n \n \u201c \u2018I\u2019m Just a Bill on Capitol Hill\u2019 is not the way this works. Freestanding bills almost never happen,\u201d Andrews said, referencing the \u201cSchoolhouse Rock\u201d cartoon about how a bill sings and dances its way through Congress. \n \n Instead, lawmaking is now done with massive pieces of legislation crammed full of ideas that might have little to do with one another. What looks like failure, Andrews said, is actually his success at working the new system. \n \n \u201cYou should ask yourself how many of the ideas that were a seed planted in the bill that germinated in a larger bill. That\u2019s the way this really works,\u201d he said. In all, he estimated, about 110 of his ideas have become law after being stuck into somebody else\u2019s bill. \n \n Andrews has spent the past two decades as a semi-liberal backbencher with no real leadership roles in the House. Andrews\u2019s legislative clout was reduced sharply when Republicans took the House in 2011, and also by lingering allegations that he used campaign funds to pay for personal and family trips. \n \n But a look at Andrews\u2019s bills shows that his lawmaking ambitions have been enormous, even when his power was not. \n \n Since Andrews arrived in Congress, no other representative has introduced more bills. In second place is Rep. Carolyn B. Maloney (D-N.Y.), followed by Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), Rep. Charles B. Rangel (D-N.Y.) and former congressman Ron Paul (R-Tex.). \n \n But all of those other lawmakers have managed to pass something into law sometime in their career. Maloney has had nine bills signed into law. Young has had 76. Rangel has had 38. And even Paul had one, a minor bill to convey a piece of federal property in Galveston, Tex. \n \n Andrews has not. The closest he has come has been to watch a senator introduce a bill similar to one of his and then see that Senate bill become law. That\u2019s happened twice, according to Joshua Tauberer, whose site govtrack.us allows users to track and compare vast amounts of data on Congress. \n \n Although it was the companion bills to Andrews\u2019s that were enacted, Tauberer said, he should get some credit for their success. \n \n \u201cOnly one of the two companion bills will actually become law, but the work to get either enacted may have been shared by the two sponsors equally,\u201d Tauberer said. \u201cIt\u2019s helpful to keep companion bills in mind when quantifying legislative activity.\u201d \n \n In one case, in 1992, both Andrews and Sen. Frank R. Lautenberg (D-N.J.) introduced bills to name a federal courthouse in Camden, N.J. Lautenberg\u2019s version was the one the president signed. \n \n Also, in 1999, both Andrews and Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-Ala.) introduced bills that changed the rules governing benefit plans run by churches. It was Sessions\u2019s bill that, after significant amendments, became law. \n \n The many other bills submitted by Andrews have, over the years, included 11 related to Taiwan, often seeking to show U.S. support for that country in its disputes with China. He has sponsored five bills to mint a commemorative coin in honor of Korean immigrants. And he has introduced at least 30 bills that would lower duties on chemicals used in manufacturing \u2014 everything from licorice extract to methoxycarbonyl-terminated perfluorinated polyoxymethylene-polyoxyethylene. \n \n And he struck out every time. \n \n At least on paper. \n \n \u201cPeople think . . . well, you introduce a bill, and then you walk around and try to get people to co-sponsor it\u201d and then it passes, Andrews said. \u201cYou know, that happens about as often as a black swan.\u201d \n \n Instead, Andrews says, he introduces bills so that he has legislative language ready for an opening. That opening, usually, is what Hill staffers call a \u201cmoving vehicle\u201d \u2014 a giant piece of legislation that, unlike most of Congress\u2019s inert bills, actually has a chance of passage. \n \n \u201cWhat happens in 90 percent of the [cases] is that certain bills move because they have to,\u201d Andrews said \u2014 often because some important deadline is about to expire. \u201cAnd those bills carry with them hundreds of ideas, or thousands of ideas that people have worked on over the years.\u201d \n \n Andrews said he has learned how to get his ideas on board by stockpiling legislative language that can be easily picked up and inserted into larger legislation. \n \n As evidence of his success, he cited changes to the military health-care program Tricare and rules about insurance coverage of orthotic devices. Some other ideas have changed government policy without being passed in any form: In 2012, Andrews trumpeted a decision by mortgage firms Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac to require prompt decisions on short sales. Andrews\u2019s actual bill to require that change had died on Capitol Hill.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 New Jersey Democrat Rob Andrews made a surprise announcement today that he'll be giving up his House seat as of Feb. 18 to join a Philadelphia law firm, reports Philly.com. And while it's big news in Jersey, Andrews isn't exactly a household name nationally. Still, the Washington Post observes that he's got a legislative track record remarkable in its own way: Over 23 years, not one of the 646 pieces of legislation Andrews authored has become law. All the more impressive is that no representative has introduced more bills than him in that span. Sure, most bills fail in Congress, but \"by those numbers, Andrews would be America\u2019s least successful lawmaker of the past two decades,\" writes David Fahrenthold. Andrews, described as a \"semi-liberal back-bencher,\" defends himself by saying that modern lawmaking these days is done through massive pieces of legislation, not through individual bills. By his own reckoning, Andrews estimates that 110 of his ideas have become law in that fashion. If he wants to eliminate the goose egg, however, maybe he can rename a post office in his final two weeks?"

The men, who were said to be brothers and demanding about $13,000, attacked Mr. Bay; the older brother also was said to have attacked three police officers who tried to intervene. Both men were charged with suspicion of assault; the younger one was also charged with suspicion of blackmail. \n \n Reuters said that Mr. Bay had been injured on the right side of his face but that the injuries were not serious, and that filming had resumed after the episode. BBC News, citing local Hong Kong reports, said that the men may have been seeking \u201cdisturbance fees\u201d paid to shops and businesses whose commerce was affected by the \u201cTransformers 4\u201d production. \n \n In a statement on Thursday, Gabriela Gutentag, a press representative for Mr. Bay, provided a somewhat different account.

Contrary to several erroneous news reports made today, Bay did not get hurt in a fight on set. The production company did have a bizarre encounter with a man (allegedly under the influence of a narcotic substance) who was wielding an air-conditioning unit as a weapon. The man, who had earlier accosted several other crew members, rushed onto the set in Quarry Bay and swung the air-conditioning unit directly at Bay\u2019s head. The director ducked and wrested the air-conditioner from his attacker, preventing what could have been a serious accident. The company\u2019s security team quickly stepped in and subdued the assault. The police, who also scuffled with the assailant and two of his companions, ultimately arrested the three men. No one on the cast or crew was injured and the production immediately resumed filming without further incident. \n \n Describing the episode in a post on his Web site, michaelbay.com, Mr. Bay wrote that his assailant \u201cwas like a Zombie in Brad Pitt\u2019s movie \u2018World War Z\u2019 \u2014 he lifted seven guys up and tried to bite them.\u201d \n \n \u201cHe actually bit into one of the guard\u2019s Nike shoe, insane,\u201d Mr. Bay continued. \u201cThank God it was an Air Max, the bubble popped, but the toe was saved.\u201d \n \n \u201cAfter that,\u201d Mr. Bay wrote, \u201cwe had a great day shooting here in Hong Kong.\u201d \n \n In an interview with The New York Times in April, Mr. Bay said he was a recognizable figure when he travels the world. \n \n \u201cI was just in the Forbidden City, and people were taking pictures of me,\u201d he said. \u201cPeople know who you are.\u201d ||||| Hong Kong Incident \n \n Posted on Oct 17, 2013 \n \n Hi, it\u2019s Michael. \n \n Yes, the story is being passed around is not all true!

One guy rolled metal carts into some of my actors trying to shake us down for thousands of dollars to not play his loud music or hit us with bricks. \n \n Every vendor where we shot got paid a fair price for our inconvenience, but he wanted four times that amount. I personally told this man and his friends to forget it we were not going to let him extort us. He didn\u2019t like that answer. So an hour later he came by my crew as we were shooting, carrying a long air conditioner unit. He walked right up to me and tried to smack my face, but I ducked threw the air unit on the floor and pushed him away. That\u2019s when the security jumped on him.

        "Summary": "Russian hackers accessed President Obama's schedule by infiltrating the White House's unclassified system via a State Department phishing email. The FBI, Secret Service, and U.S. intelligence agencies are investigating. Ben Rhodes stated the classified system was not compromised. The National Security Council emphasized the seriousness. James Clapper and Susan Collins highlighted the cyber threat. Hillary Clinton's private email server was also mentioned. The breach revealed hackers had non-public information about Obama's activities.",
        "Document": "Russian hackers who hit the White House infiltrated an unclassified computer system and apparently accessed details about President Obama's schedule. \n \n While the White House previously sought to downplay the seriousness of the hack, which took place last year, the intruders were able to see information about the president that was not publicly available, CNN reported Tuesday. \n \n Officials briefed on the investigation told CNN that the incident was connected to a Russian cyberattack that also breached the State Department's network. \n \n ADVERTISEMENT \n \n The breach of Obama\u2019s schedule is notable because the White House maintains tight control over information about the president\u2019s activities.While a general outline of the day\u2019s events is available to the press, Obama takes many meetings and phone calls throughout the day that are not publicly disclosed.The president\u2019s precise whereabouts are also not always known, and the press pool that covers Obama on a daily basis is restricted from accessing many parts of the White House building and grounds.Intimate knowledge of Obama\u2019s activities would be seen as valuable to foreign intelligence agencies like Russia\u2019s.Officials with knowledge of the investigation told CNN that Russian hackers were able to break into the White House system through their foothold within networks at the State Department.The intrusion began when hackers sent what is known as a \"phishing\" email from a State Department account, infecting a White House computer with malware, the investigators said.The State Department has been battling its own highly sophisticated cyber intrusion for months, though exactly which portions of its network remain breached is unclear.Private security experts had suspected there was a link between the State Department and White House break-ins.Russia is a key adversary of the United States in cyberspace, and is believed to have infiltrated most U.S. critical infrastructure, including installing malware in software that controls everything from oil and gas pipelines to wind turbines to nuclear power plants.The White House breach made headlines last year as a sign of hackers\u2019 increasing access to the highest levels of the U.S. government.White House officials confirmed in October that its unclassified system had been breached. Computers and systems were not damaged, officials said, though some services were disrupted as cybersecurity experts sought to limit hackers\u2019 activity in the months that followed.The \u201cvast majority\u201d of systems were back online as of late February, White House press secretary Josh Earnest said at the time. \n \n \u2014Last updated at 6 p.m. ||||| Washington (CNN) Russian hackers behind the damaging cyber intrusion of the State Department in recent months used that perch to penetrate sensitive parts of the White House computer system, according to U.S. officials briefed on the investigation. \n \n While the White House has said the breach only affected an unclassified system, that description belies the seriousness of the intrusion. The hackers had access to sensitive information such as real-time non-public details of the president's schedule. While such information is not classified, it is still highly sensitive and prized by foreign intelligence agencies, U.S. officials say. \n \n The White House in October said it noticed suspicious activity in the unclassified network that serves the executive office of the president. The system has been shut down periodically to allow for security upgrades. \n \n The FBI, Secret Service and U.S. intelligence agencies are all involved in investigating the breach, which they consider among the most sophisticated attacks ever launched against U.S. government systems. \u200bThe intrusion was routed through computers around the world, as hackers often do to hide their tracks, but investigators found tell-tale codes and other markers that they believe point to hackers working for the Russian government. \n \n National Security Council spokesman Mark Stroh didn't confirm the Russian hack, but he did say that \"any such activity is something we take very seriously.\" \n \n \"In this case, as we made clear at the time, we took immediate measures to evaluate and mitigate the activity,\" he said. \"As has been our position, we are not going to comment on [this] article's attribution to specific actors.\" \n \n Neither the U.S. State Department nor the Russian Embassy immediately responded to a request for comment. \n \n Ben Rhodes, President Barack Obama's deputy national security adviser, said the White House's use of a separate system for classified information protected sensitive national security-related items from being obtained by hackers. \n \n \"We do not believe that our classified systems were compromised,\" Rhodes told CNN's Wolf Blitzer on Tuesday. \n \n \"We're constantly updating our security measures on our unclassified system, but we're frankly told to act as if we need not put information that's sensitive on that system,\" he said. \"In other words, if you're going to do something classified, you have to do it on one email system, one phone system. Frankly, you have to act as if information could be compromised if it's not on the classified system.\" \n \n To get to the White House, the hackers first broke into the State Department, investigators believe. \n \n The State Department computer system has been bedeviled by signs that despite efforts to lock them out, the Russian hackers have been able to reenter the system. One official says the Russian hackers have \"owned\" the State Department system for months and it is not clear the hackers have been fully eradicated from the system. \n \n As in many hacks, investigators believe the White House intrusion began with a phishing email that was launched using a State Department email account that the hackers had taken over, according to the U.S. officials. \n \n Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, in a speech at an FBI cyberconference in January, warned government officials and private businesses to teach employees what \"spear phishing\" looks like. \n \n \"So many times, the Chinese and others get access to our systems just by pretending to be someone else and then asking for access, and someone gives it to them,\" Clapper said. \n \n The ferocity of the Russian intrusions in recent months caught U.S. officials by surprise, leading to a reassessment of the cybersecurity threat as the U.S. and Russia increasingly confront each other over issues ranging from the Russian aggression in Ukraine to the U.S. military operations in Syria. \n \n Sen. Susan Collins said the revelations of the Russian hack \"are troubling and further expose that our nation's defenses against cyber-attacks are dangerously inadequate.\" The Republican senator from Maine said the breach showed the need to pass legislation to encourage the government and private companies to bolster their cyber defenses. \n \n The attacks on the State and White House systems is one reason why Clapper told a Senate hearing in February that the \"Russian cyberthreat is more severe than we have previously assessed.\" \n \n The revelations about the State Department hacks also come amid controversy over former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton's use of a private email server to conduct government business during her time in office. Critics say her private server likely was even less safe than the State system. The Russian breach is believed to have come after Clinton departed State. \n \n But hackers have long made Clinton and her associates targets. \n \n The website The Smoking Gun first reported in 2013 that a hacker known as Guccifer had broken into the AOL email of Sidney Blumenthal, a friend and advisor to the Clintons, and published emails Blumenthal sent to Hillary Clinton's private account. The emails included sensitive memos on foreign policy issues and were the first public revelation of the existence of Hillary Clinton's private email address\u200b now at the center of controversy: hdr22@clintonemail.com. The address is no longer in use. ||||| A new report says Russia was behind a hack of a White House computer network last year that exposed sensitive information about President Obama. Now, federal agencies are investigating the breach, reports CBS News correspondent Bill Plante. \n \n The White House would not say who they think is responsible, but sources told CBS News it did come from Russia. The White House has two computer systems: one that handles classified information, the other non-classified information. The unclassified system is the one that was reportedly breached. \n \n \"There's always vulnerability,\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes said at a press conference. \"The fact is that's why we have a classified system because there's less risk in the classified system and that is secure. On the unclassified system we take regular actions to prevent vulnerabilities and to enhance security.\" \n \n Rhodes did not provide specifics about reports that the Russians were behind that hack of the White House's unclassified system last year. That system contains non-public information, including Mr. Obama's sensitive, unpublished schedule. \n \n The reported hack happened during a tense time between the White House and the Kremlin when Mr. Obama and Russian President Putin were at odds over Moscow's involvement in Ukraine. \n \n \"It is a demonstration that the Russians are willing to up the ante in the cyber games against the United States and they're willing to demonstrate their capabilities against the White House itself, the center of American power,\" CBS News senior national security analyst Juan Zarate. \n \n Last October, officials confirmed suspicious cyber activity was detected on the White House computer network around the same time the State Department system was compromised. According to reports, that's how the hackers slipped into the White House system. \n \n \"The reality is that Russia, China and other competitive nation states have at their command, impressive and potentially detrimental cyber tools and they are willing to use them,\" Zarate said. \n \n In February, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper told a Senate committee that the Russian cyber threat is more severe than previously assessed. ||||| Russian hackers penetrated the White House non-public, non-classified computer system for several months last year, forcing the White House to shut down the system for several days, U.S. officials said. \n \n The hacked system is not used for classified information, but is used by the White House advance and press office, the general counsel\u2019s office, and officials in the budget and legislative liaison offices. \n \n One person briefed on the hacking said the Russian invaders were difficult to detect and difficult to remove from the White House computer network, and some believe the hackers could still be hiding inside the system tonight. \n \n Ben Rhodes, Assistant to the President and Deputy National Security Advisor for Strategic Communications, declined to confirm the breach to CNN, which first reported it today. \n \n \u201cWe\u2019ve spoken to the fact that there was an event last year,\u201d Rhodes said. \u201cThere\u2019s always vulnerability and the fact is, that\u2019s why we have a classified system, because there\u2019s less risk on the classified system that is secure.\u201d \n \n The White House National Security Council released a statement saying it disclosed the malicious activity last year and said, \u201cany such activity is something we take very seriously.\u201d \n \n The White House hack comes after the State Department struggled for months to evict hackers from its own non-classified systems, also suspected to be the work of Russian hackers. That hack prompted the State Department to shut down its unclassified email system in March. \n \n US officials briefly referred to the White House cyberattack when they said last fall it was \"connected\" to the State Department hack.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Russian hackers' apparent infiltration of the White House computer network in October wasn't exactly confidence-inspiring, even though it was the unclassified portion of the system that was breached. Now US officials say some of the unclassified information that made its way onto hackers' screens was related to President Obama's itineraries\u2014not classified knowledge, but not exactly public knowledge, notes CNN. The Hill points out that although the press has access to \"a general outline\" of Obama's daily routine, there are still phone calls and meetings that aren't made public, and that foreign spies would apparently love to know about. Obama's exact location at any given point during the day is also often kept on the down-low, and certain parts of the White House are off-limits to the press, the Hill adds. Besides the White House scheduling and press offices, others who use the hacked system include the general counsel's office and the budget and legislative liaison offices, ABC News reports. The hackers are believed to have accessed the White House network by first hacking State Department files, according to investigators, which leads to the fear that hackers have gotten back into the State Department system. One official tells CNN that the hackers have \"owned\" the network \"for months.\" \"There's always vulnerability,\" Deputy National Security Adviser Ben Rhodes noted at a press conference, per CBS News. \"The fact is that's why we have a classified system because there's less risk in the classified system, and that is secure.\" (The FBI is going after one Russian hacker in particular.)"

        "Document": "In a statement from six physician groups, including the American Academy of Family Physicians, the doctors predicted that \u201callowing insurers to sell narrow, low-cost health plans likely will cause significant economic harm to women and older, sicker Americans who stand to face higher-cost and fewer insurance options.\u201d \n \n While many health insurers remained silent about the executive order, some voiced concern that it could destabilize the market. The Trump proposal \u201cwould draw younger and healthier people away from the exchanges and drive additional plans out of the market,\u201d warned Ceci Connolly, the chief executive of the Alliance of Community Health Plans. \n \n Administration officials said they had not yet decided which federal and state rules would apply to the new products. Without changing the law, they said, they can rewrite federal regulations so that more health plans would be exempt from some of its requirements. \n \n The Affordable Care Act has expanded private insurance to millions of people through the creation of marketplaces, also known as exchanges, where people can purchase plans, in many cases using government subsidies to offset the cost. It also required that plans offered on the exchanges include a specific set of benefits, including hospital care, maternity care and mental health services, and it prohibited insurers from denying coverage to people with pre-existing medical conditions. \n \n The executive order\u2019s quickest effect on the marketplaces would be the potential expansion of short-term plans, which are exempt from Affordable Care Act requirements. Many health policy experts worry that if large numbers of healthy people move into such plans, it would drive up premiums for those left in Affordable Care Act plans because the risk pool would have sicker people. \n \n \u201cIf the short-term plans are able to siphon off the healthiest people, then the more highly regulated marketplaces may not be sustainable,\u201d said Larry Levitt, a senior vice president for the Kaiser Family Foundation. \u201cThese plans follow no rules.\u201d \n \n Mr. Trump\u2019s order would also eventually make it easier for small businesses to band together and buy insurance through entities known as association health plans, which could be created by business and professional groups. A White House official said these health plans \u201ccould potentially allow American employers to form groups across state lines\u201d \u2014 a goal championed by Mr. Trump and many other Republicans \u2014 allowing more options and the formation of larger risk pools. ||||| The decision to end the payments, worth an estimated $7 billion this year, marks President Donald Trump's most aggressive move yet to dismantle Obamacare. | Brendan Smialowski/AFP/Getty Images Trump will scrap critical Obamacare subsidies Cutting off the payments to insurers, which could happen almost immediately, is likely to provide another jolt to Obamacare markets. \n \n President Donald Trump plans to cut off subsidy payments to insurers selling Obamacare coverage in his most aggressive move yet to undermine his predecessor's health care law. \n \n The subsidies, which are worth an estimated $7 billion this year and are paid out in monthly installments, may stop almost immediately, since Congress hasn\u2019t appropriated funding for the program. \n \n Story Continued Below \n \n The decision \u2014 which leaked out only hours after Trump signed an executive order calling for new regulations to encourage cheap, loosely regulated health plans \u2014 delivered a double whammy to Obamacare after months of failed GOP efforts to repeal the law. With open enrollment for the 2018 plan year set to launch in two weeks, the moves seem aimed at dismantling the law through executive actions. \n \n Press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed the decision in a statement emailed to reporters Thursday night. \n \n \u201cBased on guidance from the Department of Justice, the Department of Health and Human Services has concluded that there is no appropriation for cost-sharing reduction payments to insurance companies under Obamacare,\u201d she said. \u201cIn light of this analysis, the Government cannot lawfully make the cost-sharing reduction payments. \u2026 The bailout of insurance companies through these unlawful payments is yet another example of how the previous administration abused taxpayer dollars and skirted the law to prop up a broken system.\u201d \n \n Trump's move to scrap the subsidy payments, which was first reported by POLITICO, is likely to jolt already fragile Obamacare markets \u2014 although the impact might be less severe than it would have been a few months back. \n \n \u201cCertainly problematic markets are going to become more unstable,\" said Greg Scott, who oversees Deloitte\u2019s health plans consulting practice. \n \n Adding to the uncertainty, Trump on Friday morning appeared to express hope that his decision to cut off the subsidies would help him cut a legislative deal, possibly with Democrats. \"The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding. Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!\" Trump tweeted. \n \n The president has made overtures in the past to Democrats on health care, tweeting last Saturday that he had talked with Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer about potential negotiations. But Schumer separately said Trump had suggested another Obamacare repeal-and-replace effort, which the New York Democrat said was a nonstarter. \n \n On Thursday night, Schumer (D-N.Y.) and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi (D-Calif.) issued a joint statement calling Trump's latest move \"sabotage.\" \n \n \u201cIt is a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America,\" they said in a joint statement. \"Make no mistake about it, Trump will try to blame the Affordable Care Act, but this will fall on his back and he will pay the price for it.\" \n \n But many insurers had priced next year's plans higher than they otherwise would have, fearing this outcome after months of threats from the White House. Others have already fled the Obamacare markets, which are set to begin open enrollment in Nov. 1 for the 2018 plan year. \n \n \u201cWhat it adds up to me is a gross dereliction of duty,\u201d John Baackes, CEO of L.A. Care Health plan, said of the decision. \u201cThe Affordable Care Act is still the law of the land and the cost-reduction subsidies are part of that. \u2026 Even if there\u2019s a lawsuit about it, it should still be honored until the last appeal is exhausted. I thought they took oaths to uphold the law of the land. They\u2019re just flaunting it now.\u201d \n \n Trump has threatened for months to cut off the payments, deriding them as a \u201cbailout\u201d for insurers. California, the country\u2019s most successful Obamacare marketplace, added a 12.5 percent surcharge this week on silver plans as a hedge against the possibility the subsidies would be pulled. By loading them on silver plans, taxpayers will pick up the cost. \n \n While Republican lawmakers complained the subsidies were never properly appropriated by Congress, many were wary of ending them suddenly. \n \n Failed Obamacare repeal packages considered by the House and Senate included near-term funding for the program, which had been paid out through the executive branch each month. \n \n Attorney General Jeff Sessions said Friday on Fox News that the subsidies were not on solid legal ground to begin with because Congress did not appropriate them. He said it's up to Congress to step in. \n \n \"It's time for Congress to fix this bill. That's what needs to happen. Congress has got to get together,\" Sessions said. \"Republicans and the Democrats, they've got to come on board and they've got to develop a plan that will actually work. It can not continue in this fashion. It's in a death spiral it seems to me.\" \n \n In the near term, the announcement is expected to put more pressure on a bipartisan effort in the Senate's health committee to preserve the subsidies to shore up Obamacare marketplaces. \n \n \u201cWhile I\u2019m sure initial reactions will be negative, this might be the spark Congress needs to act on this issue,\" said an insurance lobbyist who declined to be named. \"There was no pressure before \u2026 That might actually be the silver lining.\u201d \n \n As the White House reached out to lawmakers to inform them of its decision Thursday night, even some Republican lawmakers expressed consternation. \n \n \"Cutting health care subsidies will mean more uninsured in my district,\" tweeted Rep. Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, a Florida Republican late Thursday. \"@potus promised more access, affordable coverage. This does opposite.\" \n \n New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who led a group of Democratic attorneys general to defend the subsidies in court this past spring, said they would sue to stop the administration from acting. \n \n \"I will not allow President Trump to once again use New York families as political pawns in his dangerous, partisan campaign to eviscerate the Affordable Care Act at any cost,\" he said in a prepared statement. \n \n Some insurers are also likely to sue the Trump administration over the failure to make payments that they believe they\u2019re entitled to under the Affordable Care Act. \n \n Insurers will have the option to try to adjust their rates or pull out of the markets immediately when the subsidy payments end. That's because the contracts insurance companies signed to offer Obamacare plans have an \"out\" if the payments stop. \n \n But it\u2019s far from certain whether insurers would try to leave markets. They would have to go through an extensive back-and-forth with state regulators on changes, a process that could be lengthy and could vary by state. \n \n Trump has argued that Democrats will take the blame if the markets implode, but polling strongly suggests the public will point the finger at Republicans for Obamacare problems under Trump's watch. \n \n Dan Diamond, Jennifer Haberkorn, Renuka Rayasam and Victoria Colliver contributed to this report. ||||| The Trump administration will end billions of dollars in payments to insurers under the Affordable Care Act program, but President Donald Trump has privately told at least one lawmaker that the payments may continue if a bipartisan deal is reached on heath care, according to people familiar with the matter on Capitol Hill and in the health-care industry. \n \n The White House in a statement Thursday night said that based on guidance from the Justice Department, the Department of Health and Human Services has determined there is...",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 In a move that analysts say could be a devastating blow to ObamaCare, President Trump is ending one of the health care bill's crucial subsidies. White House press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders confirmed Thursday night that the federal government will stop \"cost-sharing reduction\" payments to health insurers, which help millions of people afford insurance they get through ObamaCare's exchanges, Politico reports. Sanders called the payments a \"bailout of insurance companies\" and \"another example of how the previous administration abused taxpayer dollars and skirted the law to prop up a broken system.\" Related coverage: The impact: The Washington Post likens the decision to \"throwing a bomb into the marketplaces\" created by ObamaCare. Insurers have said this is the strongest step Trump could take to undermine the law, because rising costs would force them to bail without the promise of getting reimbursed. The alternative could be to remain, but to raise premiums to levels most couldn't afford. The New York Times also calls the subsidies \"essential\" to the Affordable Care Act. Trump's possible offer: \"The Democrats ObamaCare is imploding,\" the president tweeted Friday morning. \"Massive subsidy payments to their pet insurance companies has stopped. Dems should call me to fix!\" The last part might be the most telling. The Wall Street Journal reports that Trump has told at least one lawmaker that he's open to preserving the payments if a bipartisan deal is struck on health care. All eyes on this: Trump is referring to a deal being negotiated by GOP Sen. Lamar Alexander and Democratic Sen. Patty Murray. Under the broad strokes, the subsidies would be continued, a win for Democrats, but states would get more flexibility to avoid ObamaCare rules, a win for Republicans, per the Journal. Big deadline: Open enrollment for the ObamaCare exchanges begins in less than three weeks, raising pressure for a quick resolution. Background: A federal court declared the subsidies illegal last year, though the decision is being appealed. The subsidies add up to around $7 billion this year, a figure expected to steadily rise in coming years. The attorneys general of California and New York vowed Thursday night that they would challenge the latest move in court, while Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer called it \"a spiteful act of vast, pointless sabotage leveled at working families and the middle class in every corner of America.\" Second move: Earlier Thursday, Trump signed an executive order that's expected to undermine ObamaCare in a different way."

In a recent survey, one in three Americans (31%) who have combined their finances admitted lying to their spouses about money, and another one-third of these adults said they\u2019d been deceived. \n \n The online poll, commissioned by ForbesWoman and the National Endowment for Financial Education (NEFE) and conducted by Harris Interactive, surveyed 2,019 U.S. adults from December 17 to 21.

When they cheat financially, you have to live with the effects for however long it takes to dig out of the hole.\u201d \n \n According to the survey, over half of all financial cheaters admitted hiding cash (58%) or minor purchases (54%). NEFE\u2019s Beck says this is particularly concerning, as small lies often compound over time to become increasingly larger and more harmful deceptions. Of the offenders, 30% have hidden a bill, 16% have hidden a major purchase, 15% had a secret bank account, 11% lied about their debts and another 11% lied about the amount of money they earned. None of this surprised Nancy Chemtob, founding partner of matrimonial and family law firm Chemtob Moss Forman & Talbert LLP in New York, who says she\u2019s seen it all. According to the survey, money deception occurs equally across income levels\u2014no matter if you\u2019re earning $30,000 or $300,000. Chemtob only accepts clients with a net worth of $5 million or more and has observed that having more money only means more elaborate schemes. \n \n Example A: she once worked with the owner of a hedge fund who secretly spent millions on a mistress. In five of their 10 years of marriage, his wife had no clue that he was spending over $20,000 a month on the other woman, ultimately buying her a house, car and extravagant jewelry. \n \n Another of her clients is in her 30s, remarried and has a son from a previous marriage, Chemtob says. Three years ago, she lied to her new husband that she wasn\u2019t receiving child support. She was. Now he pays for the child\u2019s expenses and private schooling while the woman stashes about $7,000 a month in a hidden bank account. \n \n In one of the most extreme deceptions Chemtob\u2019s come across, a 20-something woman fabricated her entire financial history. The original lie happened on the first date. Because he was very well-educated, successful and high-earning, she didn\u2019t think he\u2019d like her when she told him she didn\u2019t have a degree or a job. She lied, saying she had her masters and a salaried position. \n \n The woman continued the fib while they dated and into their eventual marriage. When he left home for work, she left too. When he returned home in the evening, so did she. Because he was so successful, he paid for everything and never noticed that she didn\u2019t have an income. Eventually he did discover the truth and promptly filed for divorce. \n \n Boston-based family therapist Carleton Kendrick has been counseling couples for over 30 years and says money deception has become a huge issue in the last decade. He suspects the ease of using credit cards and purchasing online may make the act easier but doesn\u2019t explain the lies. \n \n Kendrick says the chief reasons people lie about money to their partners are pragmatism, control, guilt and fear. The pragmatic lie may result from planning an eventual split and not wanting the other to know how much money is available. Financial infidelity for control may include revenge spending, as one partner overspends to prove their independence or to get back at the other for something lacking in the relationship. Knowingly irresponsible behavior may cause guilt and embarrassment, so the person attempts to cover it up. Deceit may also occur because they fear their partner\u2019s reaction to the truth. \n \n 10 Red Flags Your Partner Is Lying About Money \n \n Kendrick notes that how we are raised influences our money philosophies in relationships and can create some gendered behaviors or assumptions. \u201cGirls still see their mothers at check-out, saying, \u2018We won\u2019t tell Daddy about this; it will be our little secret,\u2019\u201d he says. \n \n The survey revealed that men and women are equally guilty of financial infidelity, though women were slightly more likely to say they\u2019d caught their partner. Differences emerged in men and women\u2019s perceptions of their partner\u2019s guilt, however. Men were more likely to say their partners hid a minor purchase from them compared to women (59% vs. 44%, respectively). Women were three times more likely to say their partners lied about their earnings (23% vs. 8%, respectively) and also more likely to say their partners lied about the amount of debt they owed (38% vs. 26%, respectively). \n \n NEFE\u2019s Beck advises that couples have the money talk early\u2013well before marriage\u2013to avoid money lies in their relationships. If you are already married or in a committed relationship, he suggests using tax season as a nonthreatening way to ask your partner questions and gain a better grasp of shared finances. Those who suspect or discover that they are currently victims of financial infidelity should first figure out how deep the lies go and gather all the details. \n \n One-third of those in relationships impacted by money deception say they have resolved to do something this year, with most planning to communicate more openly and create a shared budget for 2011. \n \n 10 Red Flags Your Partner Is Lying About Money ||||| Starting in 1996, Alexa Internet has been donating their crawl data to the Internet Archive.

Or scrolled straight to the bottom of a pop-up window with 17 pages of boring legalese in it, just to continue installation? If your answer is anything other than \u201call the times,\u201d you are in a very, very small minority. \n \n A new study from researchers at two universities has confirmed what most of us already anecdotally know: nobody\u2019s actually reading the fine print, even if they should. \n \n And how did the researchers find this, you may ask? By creating a fictitious social networking site that research participants signed up for. The privacy policy and terms of service for this fictitious site were modeled on existing documents on another social network (LinkedIn), and checked in at roughly 8000 and 4000 words respectively. \n \n But this fake site\u2019s policies included a few extra clauses that should have raised eyebrows. One had to do with data sharing, and specified that the site could share your information with the NSA \u201cand other security agencies in the United States and abroad.\u201d It also said that your data could be shared with any third parties, and as a result \u201ccould impact eligibility in\u2026 employment, financial service, univeristy, entrance, international travel, the criminal justice system, etc.\u201d \n \n The other said that participants agreed to sign over their firstborn, Rumpelstiltskin-style: \u201cIn addition to any monetary payment \u2026 all users of this site agree to immediately assign their first-born child\u201d to the site, it read. \u201cIf the user does not yet have children, this agreement will be enforceable until the year 2050.\u201d \n \n The researchers then asked open-ended questions to the participants asking if they had any concerns with the policies and sign-up options. \n \n 543 research participants signed up for the site. Of those, 399 skipped all the fine print entirely and just signed up blindly. For the remaining 144, the average time spent \u201creading\u201d the privacy policy was 73 seconds, and for the TOS, 51 seconds. \n \n Even the best speed-readers are not going to get through \u2014 and understand \u2014 8000 words of legalese in 73 seconds, and these participants were no exception. In the end, the researchers found that 98% of all participants completely missed the existence of the \u201cgotcha\u201d clauses. That means a total of 10-11 participants, at most, actually noticed. \n \n Research participants were all undergrads, as is very common for university-based research. But this behavior is far from limited to young adults. A similar experiment in the UK in 2014 found the same results, with users unwittingly signing away their firstborn in exchange for access to a free WiFi hotspot. A UK-based retailer found the same in 2010 when their customers happily, and unwittingly, signed over their immortal souls. \n \n Other studies have found that barely one in five internet users actually read the terms, and even they probably don\u2019t usually stop to process the words. \n \n So yes, we should all read a little more carefully before we proceed \u2014 because as long as they disclose it, a company can do pretty much anything they want with your account or personal information. Of course, it doesn\u2019t help that the policies are usually long, dense, complicated, formatted badly, and full of legalese. There are some tools that help but when it comes to comprehensibility, we still have a long way to go. \n \n [via Ars Technica] ||||| 37 Pages Posted: 2 Apr 2016 Last revised: 18 Aug 2018 \n \n Date Written: June 1, 2018 \n \n Abstract \n \n This paper addresses \u2018the biggest lie on the internet\u2019 with an empirical investigation of privacy policy (PP) and terms of service (TOS) policy reading behavior. An experimental survey (N=543) assessed the extent to which individuals ignored PP and TOS when joining a fictitious social networking service, NameDrop. Results reveal 74% skipped PP, selecting the \u2018quick join\u2019 clickwrap. Average adult reading speed (250-280 words per minute), suggests PP should have taken 29-32 minutes and TOS 15-17 minutes to read. For those that didn\u2019t select the clickwrap, average PP reading time was 73 seconds. All participants were presented the TOS and had an average reading time of 51 seconds. Most participants agreed to the policies, 97% to PP and 93% to TOS, with decliners reading PP 30 seconds longer and TOS 90 seconds longer. A regression analysis identifies information overload as a significant negative predictor of reading TOS upon signup, when TOS changes, and when PP changes. Qualitative findings suggest that participants view policies as nuisance, ignoring them to pursue the ends of digital production, without being inhibited by the means. Implications are revealed as 98% missed NameDrop TOS \u2018gotcha clauses\u2019 about data sharing with the NSA and employers, and about providing a first-born child as payment for SNS access.",

(If you have no idea what I\u2019m talking about, start here.) \n \n Some fans tried making their own version of the sauce, while others made ovations to McDonald\u2019s to re-release it.

And there might be a few extra cases stacked in his office. All right, and a couple more in the kitchen. But that's it, for now. \n \n Florence estimates he has around 400 12-packs of canned soft drinks in his home right now. (If you lined those up end to end, they'd span the length of a football field... plus an Olympic-size swimming pool.) Florence is the curator of Sodafinder.com, the website he built to catalogue and sell the sodas he collects by driving all over the country to hunt down unique regional varieties. During peak shipping season, between Thanksgiving and Christmas, his stock balloons to around 600 cases. His earnings from the retail site mostly fund his road trips. But he's recently begun making a small profit, though not nearly enough to quit his full-time job at an insurance company. \"I don't want it to be work,\" he says. \"I try to make it as fun as possible.\" \n \n Florence may be the king of a community of online buyers, sellers, consumers, and collectors of rare, hard-to-find, or discontinued food and beverage items, but he's not alone. There's a market for these products \u2014\u0080\u0094 usually, for snacks people remember from childhood. \n \n Dunkaroos, for example, enjoy a healthy demand on Amazon ever since they've been discontinued in the U.S. For vendors like Patrick Meynders of Alberta, Canada, where the '90s lunchbox treat of packaged cookies and frosting is still available in stores, Dunkaroos are one of his top sellers. From his (currently offline) storefront, Canadian Sweets Treats and Other Specialties, he can move upwards of 60 five-serving boxes in a given week to U.S. customers. In 2012, another soda seller, Josh Nichols of Fort Worth, Texas, had just begun selling Dr. Pepper on eBay when the soda company announced it would stop production of Dublin Dr. Pepper, a regional favorite made with real cane sugar. He joined the mad rush of buyers who hoarded cases to sell online. Customers bought bottles even after they expired, he said, just to have as collectors' items. \n \n Others, like Toledo, Ohio's Pam Lloyd-Camp, stake their business on the demand for vintage foods. Lloyd-Camp runs a robust eBay candy shop called junk-it-junction, the online outpost of her brick-and-mortar business, Boyd's Retro Candy Store, where she sells old-timey favorites like giant Jawbreakers, candy cigarettes, and Sugar Daddies. She even has a small supply of discontinued Clark's Teaberry Gum. In a 2008 Press Publications interview, Lloyd-Camp, a baby boomer, said that she opened a candy shop \"to help our generation relive their childhood memories and to give their kids happy memories, too.\" \n \n Then there are the few casual opportunists like eBay user batwatcher, who says he had extra Diablo hot sauce from Taco Bell lying around his house when he heard it had been discontinued \u2014 and that there was a market for it online. \"If someone wants it, they will buy it. If they don't,\" he says, \"I will take it down and probably use it on my own tacos.\" \n \n Likely thanks to their sturdy shelf lives \u2014\u0080\u0094 and their role in fond childhood memories \u2014 sodas, candies, and other packaged snacks dominate this niche market. Some sellers and buyers are drawn to the hunt and the novelty of collecting rare products. Others are searching for flavors of their youth. All together, they make up a fan base with unique appreciation and reverence for shelf staples that otherwise don't get much respect in the grocery world. And when it comes to building a business on these products, vendors have their process down to a science. \n \n Florence remembers the first time he bought a Mr. Pibb in the late \u201890s from an Iowa rest-stop vending machine. \"I was like, I don't know what that is, I've never heard of that,\" he says. He liked it, but it was more a novelty than a delicacy. Soon afterward, he began collecting cases of unfamiliar sodas during road trips from his home in upstate New York to Nebraska. He was never a fanatical soda drinker, but he couldn't resist the search for new things. \"It was more like the scavenger hunt just to find them. It's the challenge.\" \n \n When Florence amassed more than he could drink or give away, he took to the web, and launched his website Sodafinder.com in 2002. He's since dabbled in selling on eBay, but never got many bids, and he won't consider selling on Amazon Marketplace, which charges 99 cents per item sold or a $39.99 monthly subscription fee. \n \n Today, Sodafinder lists over 150 varieties of hard-to-find soft drinks, including 10 discontinued flavors that come with a warning label: \"This item is out of date. Drink at your own risk!\" His best sellers include Wink, a refreshing grapefruit-based citrus soda popular in the \u201860s that has since been relegated to a few regional bottlers in the Southeast U.S. (Florence gets his supply near Charlotte, North Carolina); Buffalo Rock Ginger Ale, which Florence describes as \"the spiciest you'll ever have in your life,\" produced by one independent bottling company in Birmingham, Alabama; Tom Tucker Mint Ginger Ale from Pennsylvania; as well as the simple but deliciously scarce Coca-Cola made with real sugar. The kind Florence buys and sells is made with sucrose, which some consider a step below the cane sugar formula used in Mexican Coke (which Florence also sells by the single glass bottle), but it's a major improvement over high-fructose corn syrup. \"Corn syrup is a syrup \u2014\u0080\u0094 you can tell on your tongue,\" Florence says. Sugar tastes more natural. \n \n Discontinued flavors are sold with a warning label reading \"This item is out-of-date. Drink at your own risk!\" \n \n The majority of Florence's customers want sodas to consume, not collect, but that doesn't make their motivations any less nostalgic. \"It's not just soda,\" Florence says. \"The taste ties into all your senses and brings back memories.\" He sees evidence of this in customer reviews. \"My mother was a fan of Wink soda growing up, so I bought her two two-liters of Wink for Mother's Day,\" wrote one shopper. \"She was super happy and she said it tasted just as she remembered!\" \n \n \n \n Meynders, the Amazon Dunkaroos salesman, started his storefront with the assumption that people would pay to relive childhood memories. The son of an Indonesian mother and a Dutch father, he often drives an hour-and-a-half to a European deli in order to buy ingredients, like Conimex Ketjap, to recreate the dishes of his youth. According to Meynders, he soon realized that \"I can't be the only one that is looking for things of my past,\" and opened his storefront in 2015. Indeed, customers who buy Dunkaroos from him leave reviews like, \"Same great taste & brings back childhood memories for my grown kids.\" \n \n People feel nostalgia when \"we reflect on on a time that we think was \u2014 and probably was \u2014 somewhat simpler, calmer, and pleasant,\" says Darrel D. Muehling, chair of the Washington State University Carson College of Business' department of marketing and international business, who has researched the use of nostalgia in advertising. \"If we can capture a piece of that past by buying a product or reflecting on something, that tends to generate a positive feeling.\" \n \n Muehling points out that we often see the past through rose-tinted glasses, remembering only the good parts. He says generating that childhood yearning for products is a balancing act for advertisers, who need to be careful not to over-promise an experience from years gone by. \"There's this twist on nostalgia, that you really can never return to your past,\" he says. \"You can consume a product, but you can't consume a product as a seven-year-old.\" What tasted good to your elementary-school palate might not be as delicious several decades later; this can lead to disillusioned shoppers, like the one who a review for Meynder saying the cookies-and-icing \"tastes nothing like American Dunkaroos used to, so beware if you are ordering on the basis of nostalgia.\" \n \n Still, people seem determined to try to recapture those moments, and sometimes, it's a challenge for vendors to keep up. At least once a week, Meynders drives across the border three hours to a post office in Sweet Grass, Montana to get a better price on shipping his products to U.S. customers. Still, he says selling scarce foods on Amazon is his passion project \u2014\u0080\u0094 he hides the store's landing page whenever he's out of town or unable to ship product. Florence maintains his stock with three road trips a year \u2014\u0080\u0094 two shorter jaunts during three- or four-day weekends, and one week-long journey. He rents to save his own car from the wear and tear, and so he can get a van with a solid rear axle that keeps the tires from buckling inward under the soda weight. \n \n Florence has learned where to get his supply by trial and error, putting in the miles. On his most recent trip, he traveled a 4,000-mile route through State College and Pittsburgh to Cleveland, Chicago, then the Quad Cities, Des Moines, Omaha, and down through Springfield and Columbus on the way home. Of the approximately 175 12-packs and 85 two-liter bottles of soda he unloaded when he returned, the trophy of the trip was Nehi Grape soda, which Florence was surprised to find at an independent bottler in Evansville, Indiana. Sometimes he gets tips from his fans on the Soda Finder Facebook page, but for the most part, he just shows up at grocery stores, Walmarts, convenience stores, and bottling companies along his routes. His trips are also how he monitors the ebb and flow of products on the market. He thinks Pepsi is phasing out Sierra Mist, for example, but he hasn't read that anywhere. He's just been seeing less of it. \n \n Florence sold his last case of dnL, a lemony, caffeinated drink by the makers of 7 Up, for $140. \n \n Getting the product is one thing \u2014 the dance between legally purchasing items then pricing them for a profit is another art altogether. Nichols, the Dublin Dr. Pepper eBay vendor, says he forged a direct relationship with the soda company. Today, he special-orders fresh cases of Dr. Pepper made with pure cane sugar, just not bottled in Dublin anymore. He says he has never changed his price of $29.99 for a six-pack of eight-ounce glass bottles. People are willing to pay for it. \"A lot of people buy them to put in vending machines from the \u201850s and that's the only thing that fits,\" he says. \n \n Florence has his own system. He assumes the big soda companies know he's around \u2014\u0080\u0094 he's seen coca-cola.com and pepsi.com on his site's IP log \u2014\u0080\u0094 but they've never given him trouble, he says, because he buys the drinks as a customer and pays sales tax; he never tries to buy wholesale. To set his prices, Florence used to add up the cost of soda, gas, car rental, and food and divide it by the number of items he'd purchased. Now he does a little better than breaking even because he adjusts according to demand. He sells most soft drinks for $15 to $25 for a case of 12 cans. He has regulars who order from him every few months, usually basic flavors or regular, real-sugar, and diet sodas. One customer buys Nehi Grape with real sugar three times a year. Other buyers are willing to pay big bucks for discontinued sodas. Florence sold his last case of dnL, a lemony, caffeinated drink by the makers of 7up, for $140. His priciest listings ever were twin 12-packs of discontinued Pepsi Blue and the original Mr. Pibb, after Pibb Xtra replaced it, for $600 each. \"I never sold them, but it would always get me attention,\" he says. He did succeed, though, in eventually off-loading individual cans of Pepsi Blue as collectors' items for $25 each. \n \n The next soda-hunting trip on Florence's schedule is a Southern run, maybe around the Fourth of July. He'll swing through Philadelphia for flavored Canada Dry, pick up Sunkist Fruit Punch in DC, Northern Neck ginger ale in Virginia, and Wink in the Carolinas. Maybe he'll make a stop at the Buffalo Rock bottler in Alabama for that spicy ginger ale, and with luck he'll pick up some Pibb Xtra and unique flavors of Fanta like peach and pineapple while he's down there. \n \n Florence is transparent about where he buys most of his products. His customers pay for the convenience of having a scarce soda shipped to their doors, not because he has secret hookups or hidden sources. Except one. Before he got married, he says, he had all the fridge space he could want for his personal soft drink supply. Now, he chills a single 12-pack of his favorite: Coke with real sugar. And he won't say where he buys it. That's his sweet secret. \n \n Andrea Marks is a freelance writer based in New York City. \n \n Editor: Erin DeJesus ||||| These crawls are part of an effort to archive pages as they are created and archive the pages that they refer to.

People shell out big bucks for nostalgic food products on eBay all the time, but this is an unusually high price tag. Its popularity can only be explained by a viral stunt that the creators of Adult Swim animated comedy Rick and Morty launched a few weeks back. \n \n Please God, I don't ask for much, please let us gain enough cultural influence to force McDonald's into bringing back that fucking sauce. \u2014 Rick (((and Morty))) (@RickandMorty) April 2, 2017 \n \n To coincide with the debut of their April Fools\u2019 Day episode, which had a plot line about the Mulan sauce, the Rick and Morty team started a Change.org campaign asking McDonald\u2019s to bring back the dip. As of press time, this campaign has received over 20,000 signatures. The team even had some success engaging with McDonald\u2019s on social media: \n \n Rick and Morty fans also flooded the comments of the YouTube video of the commercial for the sauce with references to the show: \n \n Although McDonald\u2019s has not announced any official plans to bring the sauce back, a spokesperson recently remarked: \u201cWe never say never, because when our customers speak, we listen.\u201d \n \n Until the chain\u2019s head honchos decide to put the sauce back into commission, fans can continue to troll eBay, hoping and praying that someone else in the world discovers a lost packet of \u201cSzechuan dip.\u201d Currently, one eBay seller is offering another packet of the sauce for the comparatively low buy-it-now price of $1,000: \n \n \u2022 Man makes more than \u00a311,500 after selling rare vintage Asian-style dipping sauces from McDonald's [Mirror] \n \n \u2022 Get Mcdonalds to bring back the Szechuan Mcnugget Dipping Sauce for the new Mulan movie [Chang.org] \n \n \u2022 The Secret World of Selling \u2018Nostalgic\u2019 Food [Eater]",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 This is either a big fan of the cartoon Rick and Morty, a hopeful collector, or a very brave and nostalgic soul: A packet of 1998 McDonald's Szechuan sauce has sold for $14,700 on eBay, reports Time. The strange background: McDonald's put out the dipping sauce in that year as a publicity tie-in for the Disney movie Mulan, and it received a giant nostalgic push when the character Rick from the popular Adult Swim show pined for it in a recent episode. That led to a viral campaign for McDonald's to bring it back, complete with multiple Change.org petitions. The company has hinted it might do so, and hopeful fans have noted that a remake of Mulan is in the works for next year. But the eBay sale is the strangest component yet. \"I just bought a really old car, while cleaning it I found a packet of this sauce,\" the listing stated. \"After watching the recent episode of Rick and Morty I went online to see if it was worth anything. Turns out it was. Also this comes with a packet of wasabi as well.\" A post at Eater notes that what it calls \"nostalgic food\" is popular on eBay, \"but this is an unusually high price tag.\" No word yet on the identity of the buyer, or plans for the sauce, but the Daily Dot is issuing a challenge: The character Rick would definitely eat the stuff, \"so how about it, new owner of rare McDonald\u2019s Mulan dipping sauce. Are you squanchy enough to be a Rick?\" (A brother recently drove his sister to McDonald's, which is notable only because they have a combined age of 11.)"

Multiple neuropathologists confirmed the diagnosis. \n \n Mirra is the first action sports athlete to be diagnosed with chronic traumatic encephalopathy, a neurodegenerative disease that can lead to dementia, memory loss and depression. He died on Feb. 4 from a self-inflicted gunshot wound. \n \n The tau protein deposits found in Mirra's brain were indistinguishable from the kind that have been found in the brains of former football and hockey players with CTE, Dr. Lili-Naz Hazrati, the Toronto neuropathologist, told ESPN The Magazine. \n \n Editor's Picks Wife of Dave Mirra, first action sports athlete with CTE, discusses his last weeks and legacy BMX pioneer Dave Mirra is the first action sports athlete to be diagnosed with CTE. In an exclusive interview, his wife, Lauren Mirra, speaks about his diagnosis, his last weeks and his legacy. \n \n \"I couldn't tell the difference,\" she said. \"The trauma itself defines the disease, not how you got the trauma.\" \n \n The trademark tau protein deposits were found in the frontal and temporal lobes of Mirra's brain. \n \n \"It's assumed it is related to multiple concussions that happened years before,\" she said. \n \n Mirra, who was 41, suffered a fractured skull when a car hit him at age 19, and he dabbled in boxing after his retirement from BMX. But he also endured countless concussions during his BMX career, beginning at a young age. \n \n A legend in freestyle BMX, Mirra was the face of his sport to the mainstream. Until 2013, he owned the record for the most X Games medals in history with 24. He also had a successful video game series and hosted a show on MTV. After retiring from competitive BMX in 2011, Mirra competed in the sports of rallycross and triathlon. \n \n After his death, Mirra's family decided to have his brain studied for CTE. At the request of the Mirra family, Hazrati sent images of her prepared slides, without background information or Mirra's name attached, to additional U.S. and Canadian neuropathologists for their opinions. Each confirmed Hazrati's diagnosis of CTE. \n \n \"It validates what we have been thinking about brain injuries in boxers and football players,\" Hazrati said. \"The key is brain injury. Regardless of how you get it, through BMX or hockey, you are at risk for this.\" \n \n CTE is a progressive disease associated with repeated head trauma. Although long known to occur in boxers, it was not discovered in football players and other athletes until 2002. \n \n Mirra's widow, Lauren, received the diagnosis about her late husband in March. In an exclusive interview with ESPN The Magazine for its June 6 issue, she spoke about Mirra's diagnosis and legacy, and she detailed personality changes in his final year. \n \n \"I started to notice changes in his mood. And then it quickly started to get worse,\" Lauren said. \"He wasn't able to be present in any situation or conversation, so it was hard to be in a relationship with him to any degree. He was lost. I looked straight through him on a few occasions. And I was like, 'Where are you? Where are you? What is wrong?' \n \n \"This is the beginning of bringing awareness.

He was found dead at the age of 41 on Feb. 4. (Jenny Starrs/The Washington Post) \n \n In a decade-old video, BMX star Dave Mirra spoke of riding a bike in terms usually reserved for the priesthood. BMX wasn\u2019t just a trend, he said, but a vocation \u2014 and a life sentence. \n \n \u201cI was born in 1974 in a small town in upstate New York \u2014 a time when bicycle motocross was just about to blow up the scene,\u201d he said. \u201cBy the mid-\u201980s, freestyle BMX was the coolest thing I\u2019d ever seen. It was a movement, and I was part of it. Just about every kid across America was riding BMX. There was at a time in high school when most kids traded their bikes for a car. I had to make a choice: Follow them or follow my heart. \u2026 I just kept on riding. As far as I was concerned, I was sentenced to life.\u201d \n \n Now that Mirra \u2014 found dead Thursday of a gunshot wound in his truck at his home in Greenville, N.C. \u2014 has apparently killed himself, it\u2019s easy to forget the great dangers he faced everyday in pursuit of his calling. BMX bikers are in peril every time they compete or practice, defying gravity as casually as the rest of us change toner in the copier. \n \n [BMX icon Dave Mirra dead at 41 of apparent suicide] \n \n Or, sometimes, not: \n \n And, in his career, Mirra endured \u2014 and triumphed over \u2014 at least two terrible accidents that devastated his body and left him wondering whether he would ever compete again. \n \n In the first, he was just a pedestrian. In 1993, at age 19, Mirra \u2014 who had just gotten out of high school and gone pro \u2014 was leaving a club in Syracuse when a drunk driver plowed into him, fracturing his skull and dislocating his shoulder. \n \n \u201cA car going 45 hurts a lot more than you falling from 15 feet and hitting the ground,\u201d he later said. \u201cBut it all hurts.\u201d \n \n The accident left him with a blood clot in his brain. \n \n \u201cThey said that if I was a football player, they\u2019d never let me play again,\u201d he said, \u201cbut I wasn\u2019t going to let that control my destiny.\u201d Besides, giving up riding wasn\u2019t really an option \u2014 and there was no one to stop him. \n \n \u201cThey couldn\u2019t control what I did because it was an independent sport,\u201d he said. \u201cMaybe at first I was a little nervous, but I missed it so much.\u201d \n \n Mirra was riding again within a year. \n \n \u201cThe blood clot went away real soon, and I was fine,\u201d he said. \u201cBasically, I just figured I\u2019d been riding my whole life and I\u2019m not going to stop now.\u201d \n \n Getting hit by a car wasn\u2019t really that different than getting hassled by squares, he said. \n \n \u201cIt was a setback, but something I overcame. It doesn\u2019t even mess with me at all,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s no different than that teacher in sixth grade telling me I wasn\u2019t going to go anywhere \u2014 a roadblock. In life there are obstacles you have to go through. Whatever it is, you overcome eventually. I\u2019m fortunate not to be hurt physically so that I can move on. Back then it was a big deal, but it\u2019s behind me.\u201d He also once noted: There was \u201cno brain damage that I know of.\u201d \n \n Although Mirra wasn\u2019t really the type to preach, the crash that almost ended his career certainly made him a fan of designated drivers. \n \n \u201cI haven\u2019t been involved in any public service announcements, but it is my stand that drunk driving is not safe, and I would urge people not to drink and drive,\u201d he said. \u201cIt\u2019s not worth it.\u201d \n \n Mirra in 2005. (Nick Laham/Getty Images) \n \n In 2006, Mirra had another close call he later called his \u201cworst crash ever.\u201d \n \n \u201cIt was the first day of BMX park practice before the Summer X Games,\u201d he told Men\u2019s Fitness \u2014 a publication impressed by \u201cwhat extreme athletes put their bodies through\u201d \u2014 in 2007. \u201cI did a few practice runs and started to push it a little bit each time. The final hit was a mess. I missed the landing and came down flat. As I leaned back to suck it up, my ass hit the back tire, my bike instantly stopped, and I went straight over the bars to the ground. I basically fell 16 feet straight to my head. Just after I hit the ground, I thought for sure I broke all the ribs on the right side and my sternum was smashed. I couldn\u2019t breathe, so a collapsed lung crossed my mind. I knew something was wrong.\u201d \n \n It turned out Mirra had almost destroyed his liver. \n \n \u201cI ended up with a Grade 4 laceration on my liver \u2014 Grade 5 is the worst you can get,\u201d he said. \u201cI spent two days in ICU and had to stay off my bike for close to four months. The biggest challenge is getting back to 100 percent mentally. But after four months off my bike, I was ready to take some chances again. I spent so much time preparing myself in my mind to ride that I was ready to go when the time came.\u201d \n \n For a guy used to pushing his body to the limits, recovery demanded patience. \n \n \u201cI realized there\u2019s nothing you can do about an injury or having a bad day,\u201d he said of the healing process. \u201cMy mind-set right now is all about having fun when I\u2019m out riding and not putting too much pressure on myself. I\u2019ve won enough; I\u2019ve proved myself. Winning feels good \u2014 I\u2019m still out there riding my best and keeping up the standard for riding, and I don\u2019t plan on slowing down anytime soon. I\u2019m just focusing more on enjoying myself: staying positive and doing what I do best.\u201d \n \n If Mirra did take his own life, something tragic led him off of this positive path. But, when remembering the obstacles he did overcome, perhaps it\u2019s also best to remember his nickname: \u201cMiracle Man.\u201d",

She was later sexually assaulted at his home, possibly after being drugged, the suit contends. \n \n Police investigating the sexual assault were sympathetic toward the man and wrongly focused on Rondini's actions, which including taking a handgun and $3 for cab fare from his home, the lawsuit claims. \n \n \"Megan ultimately was treated as a crime suspect and her status as a victim of a sex crime was completely disregarded,\" the suit said. The young woman withdrew from Alabama and returned home to Texas, where her mental condition deteriorated, according to the complaint. \n \n The man wasn't charged, and the lawsuit claims investigators and university officials mishandled her allegations. The suit contends Rondini afterward suffered depression, anxiety and post-traumatic stress disorder, which her parents say led to her suicide. \n \n The lawsuit names the man, but The Associated Press is not using his name since he was not charged with a crime. It also names Beth Howard, Title IX coordinator at Alabama; Cara Blake of the school's Women and Gender Resource Center; Tuscaloosa County Sheriff Ron Abernathy; and two county officers, investigator Adam Jones and deputy Joshua Hastings. \n \n In a statement, the university declined comment on specifics of the lawsuit but said school officials were \"deeply saddened\" by Rondini's death and are trying to raise community awareness and support victims of sexual assault. \n \n A lawyer for the man named in the lawsuit denied that he had sexually assaulted her. \n \n \"The allegations against my client as set forth in this baseless lawsuit are simply false,\" the statement said. \n \n Abernathy said the case was referred to a grand jury, which declined to issue an indictment. Letting grand jurors consider evidence rather than filing immediate charges is standard practice in cases with \"very conflicting statements,\" Abernathy said. \n \n The lawsuit was assigned to a federal magistrate judge Monday, but no hearing date was set. \n \n The complaint doesn't seek a specific amount of money. It asks for a court order requiring the sheriff's office to provide better training to officers and \"to provide safe conditions to citizens around criminal investigations.\" ||||| A lawsuit accuses law enforcement and university officials of failing to give Megan Rondini, the subject of a BuzzFeed News story, the help she needed after she reported being assaulted by a wealthy man in Tuscaloosa, Alabama. \n \n The parents of a young woman who killed herself after alleging she\u2019d been raped by a wealthy Alabama man have sued the accused attacker, law enforcement officers, and a university Title IX official, alleging their \u201cfaulty practices\u201d and \u201cmishandling\u201d of the case drove their daughter to hang herself. The story of Megan Rondini, who was a student at the University of Alabama in Tuscaloosa when the alleged rape occurred, was detailed in a recent BuzzFeed News story. The 25-page wrongful death suit filed Sunday by Rondini\u2019s parents, Michael and Cynthia Rondini, charges that Tuscaloosa Sheriff's Department deputies were intentionally dismissive when Rondini reported in July 2015 that she was raped by T.J. Bunn, Jr., one of six defendants named in the suit. It accuses investigator Adam Jones and deputy Joshua Hastings of the Tuscaloosa Sheriff\u2019s Department of conducting sloppy investigations. Also named in the suit is Tuscaloosa Sheriff Ronald Abernathy, for allegedly failing to properly train his department in how to handle sexual assault reports. In addition, the Rondinis are suing Beth Howard, the University of Alabama\u2019s Title IX coordinator, who also held that position when their daughter reported she had been raped; and Cara Blakes, who was a graduate student working as a therapist at the school\u2019s Women and Gender Resource Center. All of the defendants \u201cnegligently, recklessly, wantonly, and/or wrongfully acted or failed to act in response to Megan\u2019s reported sexual assault,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. As a result, it says, Megan Rondini suffered \u201cextreme depression, anxiety, PTSD, fear, panic attacks, decline of cognitive functions and general well-being, weight loss, and feelings of worthlessness and hopelessness, all of which directly led to Megan\u2019s loss of life.\u201d \n \n W. Ivey Gilmore, Jr., an attorney for Bunn, said in a statement Monday that the accusations against his client in the suit are false. \"It is, perhaps, natural to want to find someone to blame when a young woman takes her life,\" Gilmore said. \"But accusing law enforcement and those who counseled this young woman for her actions is misguided. Unfortunately, bringing this matter before the courts in this civil action will only prolong grief without changing the reality.\" No one else named in the suit immediately responded to a request for comment. The suit, filed by Birmingham-based attorney Leroy Maxwell Jr., seeks an unspecified amount of damages. Megan Rondini\u2019s death came to light in the BuzzFeed News report, which used law enforcement interrogation videos, text messages, and other documentation to show her growing frustration after she told Tuscaloosa law enforcement that she\u2019d been raped after a night out with friends. Rondini accused T.J. Bunn Jr. in the assault, but Bunn said they had consensual sex. Tuscaloosa officers questioned why Rondini didn't kick or hit Bunn and concluded the incident did not meet Alabama\u2019s legal requirements for rape. They also questioned Rondini about crimes she had allegedly committed, including taking money and a gun from Bunn\u2019s car as she fled his home after the alleged assault. Rondini ultimately dropped the case, left the University of Alabama, and moved back to her native Texas, where she hanged herself in February 2016. Bunn was never charged with a crime. The article led to outrage in Congress. Last Wednesday, Rep. Ted Poe, a Republican from Texas, described Rondini's case and said \"she got the death penalty\u201d after reporting she\u2019d been sexually assaulted. Poe criticized Tuscaloosa investigators, saying they treated Rondini \u201cwith disdain and disbelief.\" \"It\u2019s easy to second guess what someone should or should not have done after emotional trauma of sexual assault, but Megan believes she did everything a rape victim is supposed to do,\" Poe said on the House floor. \n \n The lawsuit says Tuscaloosa officers failed to test Rondini's rape kit, failed to interview witnesses, and failed to record all of the interviews they did conduct. Their behavior \u201cwas intentional and due to Megan Rondini\u2019s female gender,\u201d the suit alleges. \n \n \u201cMegan ultimately was treated as a crime suspect and her status as a victim of a sex crime was completely disregarded,\u201d the lawsuit alleges. \"The only conclusive evidence gathered from the investigation was that Megan tested positive for a sexually transmitted disease that she contracted from non-consensual sex with Defendant Bunn,\" the suit states. Bunn's family is well-known in the Tuscaloosa area. His father and uncle own S.T. Bunn Construction, which took down its website following the BuzzFeed News story as people online directed outraged readers to their contact page. In a statement released shortly after the story appeared, Bunn's family called the article \"an intentional distortion of facts in a tragic case,\" and said Rondini's family had previously sought to sue \"various parties who are the targets of these unfounded accusations.\" \n \n \"It is tragic that this young woman took her own life, but defaming an entire city, its leaders, its institutions and a prominent family brings no honor to this tragedy and no justice for anyone,\" the Bunn family said in its statement. The University of Alabama has said the BuzzFeed News story \"ignored some significant facts,\" including that it gave Rondini information about services available to her on campus. It also noted that it referred Rondini to another counselor because the first one she met with after the alleged assault knew the Bunn family and recused herself from the case. However, the Rondini family claims in the lawsuit that the second counselor Rondini was referred to, Cara Blakes, \"inexplicably denied Megan counseling services\" until she began taking anti-anxiety medication. The lawsuit alleges this was a violation of Rondini's rights under the Americans with Disabilities Act. The suit also says that Beth Howard, the University of Alabama's Title IX coordinator, ignored calls and messages from Rondini's family requesting help for their daughter. The suit was filed in US District Court in Alabama. Anna Voremberg, a board member of End Rape on Campus, an advocacy group that has assisted Rondini's parents, accused investigators of appearing more sympathetic to Bunn in videotaped interviews than to Rondini, who was the one reporting a violent crime. \"Why would someone come forward to report any violence at all? It was just like a good ol' boys club in there,\" Voremberg told BuzzFeed News. \"Megan is just one example of many in which law enforcement officers truly fail survivors of sexual violence and their community.\" Katie J.M.

It claims the sheriff's office inadequately pursued the investigation and did not take Megan's claims seriously, and the university did not give her adequate psychological treatment and support after the alleged rape. \n \n Leroy Maxwell Jr., the Rondinis' attorney, said the lawsuit was filed with the hope that it would prevent cases similar to Megan's. \n \n \"There was a mediation with the Rondini family and the university, the details of which are confidential. The Rondini family is not in this for the money, they are only interested in shining a bright light on a tragic yet preventable situation,\" he said in a statement sent to AL.com. \"The court will determine if this case rises to the level of punitive damages.\" \n \n Meanwhile, the school, DCH Regional Medical Center, victim advocates, the Tuscaloosa District Attorney's office and law enforcement are establishing two sexual assault programs that care for sexual assault victims. \n \n \"While this long-term solution is being implemented, DCH is training its staff in the SANE [Sexual Assault Nurse Examiner] course curriculum,\" the groups said Friday in a joint press release. \n \n Terry Bunn Jr., Rondini's alleged rapist, could not immediately be reached for comment. The lawsuit identifies him as being part of a family that is \"well connected and powerful in the Tuscaloosa community, and were major financial supporters of UA.\" Bunn works at ST Bunn Construction Company, which is across the street from the Innisfree Pub, where Megan was allegedly drunk or drugged before being raped for 30 minutes in July 2015. \n \n His lawyer, W. Ivey Gillmore, said in a statement to AL.com that the lawsuit is \"baseless and \"simply false.\" \n \n \"Law enforcement investigated this matter; the district attorney's office reviewed the evidence; the evidence was even presented to a grand jury that found there was no justification for charges against my client. It is, perhaps, natural to want to find someone to blame when a young woman takes her life,\" Gillmore said. \"But accusing law enforcement and those who counseled this young woman for her actions is misguided. Unfortunately, bringing this matter before the courts in this civil action will only prolong grief without changing the reality.\" \n \n The filing goes on to claim that authorities sided with Bunn's version of events and did not thoroughly follow-up on Megan's story, and that an investigating officer was more interested in finding out whether Megan committed any crimes on the night of the rape. \n \n The university allegedly \"deliberately and repeatedly denied services and mishandled accommodations with hostility toward\" Megan, the suit goes on to say. The lawsuit claims Megan confided in a UA counselor who told her she could no longer give her therapy because she was a family friend of the Bunns, and that a second counselor would not see Megan unless she first took anxiety medication. \n \n The lawsuit claimed UA did not accommodate Megan after the rape, alleging that she saw Bunn's car outside her apartment and saw her alleged rapist on the Tuscaloosa campus. \n \n Prior to the lawsuit, the university had issued this statement: \n \n \"The University of Alabama has been deeply saddened by the death of Megan Rondini, and we continue to offer our sympathy to her friends and family. Information published by news outlets this week has unfortunately ignored some significant facts,\" UA said. \"When Megan went to the hospital, a university advocate met her at the hospital to provide support and stayed with her throughout the examination process. Megan also received information from university representatives regarding services available to her on campus, including counseling through the university's Women & Gender Resource Center. When she sought counseling and her first therapist identified a potential conflict as defined by her professional obligations, Megan was immediately introduced to another therapist, who provided care and support. Additionally, the UA Title IX Office was in contact with Megan, including offering academic accommodations and helping to streamline her withdrawal when Megan elected to return to Texas.\" \n \n Megan returned home to Austin, Texas, where the trauma from the rape and the response from law enforcement and the university caused her to kill herself, the lawsuit claims. \n \n \"The combined trauma due to Megan's treatment by the Tuscaloosa Sheriff's Department, the reporting process with UA, the additional anxiety of trying and failing to receive counseling as a result of her rape, and the influential position of her assailant in the community ultimately made Megan feel unsafe on campus and that she could no longer remain at UA,\" the lawsuit stated. \n \n Megan hung herself on February 26, 2016. Two days before, she sent a text that read: \"When all is said and done, I wonder what I could've accomplished if one man didn't completely rip everything away from me.\" \n \n A copy of the lawsuit is posted below: \n \n Rondini Lawsuit by hkoplowitz on Scribd \n \n Updated at 6:30 p.m. to include a statement from Bunn's attorney.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Former University of Alabama student Megan Rondini would still be alive if not for the \"mishandling\" of her alleged rape, her parents say. In a wrongful death lawsuit filed Sunday, Rondini's parents accuse the university, school officials, sheriff's deputies, and Rondini's alleged rapist of enabling her suicide in February 2016. Rondini had been a 20-year-old student at the University of Alabama in July 2015 when she alleged she was raped by local businessman TJ Bunn Jr. But authorities \"wrongfully acted or failed to act in response,\" the lawsuit alleges, per Buzzfeed. It adds deputies\u2014who found the case didn't meet Alabama's legal definition for rape\u2014didn't test Rondini's rape kit or interview witnesses, an \"intentional\" behavior that was due to Rondini's gender. Rondini\u2014who allegedly stole $3 and a gun from Bunn\u2014was \"treated as a crime suspect,\" not a victim, the suit continues, per the AP, also alleging a school counselor refused to see Rondini unless she took anxiety medication. Rondini later dropped out of school, moved back to Texas, and suffered \"extreme depression, anxiety, PTSD, fear, panic attacks, decline of cognitive functions and general well-being \u2026 all of which directly led to Megan's loss of life,\" the suit states.

(Associated Press) \n \n James Shaw speaks after a news conference Sunday, April 22, 2018 in Nashville, Tenn. Shaw wrestled the gun from a man who opened fire in a Waffle House restaurant earlier in the day, killing at least four people. (AP Photo/Sheila Burke) (Associated Press) \n \n NASHVILLE, Tenn. (AP) \u2014 As an intensive manhunt continues for the suspect in a Waffle House restaurant shooting that killed four people, police are warning residents of a Nashville neighborhood to beware of the alleged killer. \n \n More than 80 Nashville police officers continued to search for Travis Reinking early Monday, authorities said. Agents with the FBI, the U.S. Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives and troopers with the Tennessee Highway Patrol were also assisting in the manhunt as disturbing reports about the wanted man's past behavior came to light. \n \n He was also added to the Tennessee Bureau of Investigation's Top 10 Most Wanted list. \n \n Reinking was nearly naked, wearing only a green jacket and brandishing an assault-style rifle when he opened fire in the parking lot and then stormed the restaurant, police say. In addition to the four people killed, four others were injured. Police credit a quick-thinking customer who wrestled the gun away from the suspect for preventing more loss of life. \n \n Metropolitan Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson said at a news conference that Reinking, 29, was last seen Sunday around a wooded area near an apartment complex where he lived. Authorities said Reinking could be armed and weren't ruling out that he had left the area. He was believed to be wearing only pants and no shirt or shoes. \n \n Nashville Police Chief Steve Anderson said there was no clear motive, though Reinking may have \"mental issues.\" He may still be armed, Anderson told a mid-afternoon news conference, because he was known to have owned a handgun that authorities have not recovered. \n \n \"He's on foot,\" Anderson said. \"Unless he's been picked up by a car, he would be fairly close. We don't want to alarm people, but certainly, everybody should take precautions. It could be he's in an unoccupied house. We want everybody to be concerned. Neighbors should check on each other.\" \n \n Officials with the Nashville public school system say schools will go into \"lock-out\" mode if Reinking isn't found in time for class Monday. During the lock-out students will be free to move about the building but no guests or visitors will be allowed to enter the building. \n \n The search continued as police reports from Illinois came in that portrayed Reinking as a disturbed man with paranoid delusions, and one who liked firearms. \n \n The reports were among multiple past red flags about the suspect, who had just recently moved to Nashville from Morton, Illinois. \n \n Reinking was arrested by agents with the U.S. Secret Service back in July after he crossed a restricted area near the White House, officials said. He was detained after refusing to leave, saying he wanted to meet President Donald Trump. \n \n In May 2016, deputies from Tazewell County, Illinois, were called to a CVS parking lot. Reinking told officers that Taylor Swift was stalking him and hacking his phone, and that his family was also involved, according to a report released Sunday. \n \n It is not clear why Reinking moved to Nashville and if it had anything to do with being near the pop/country superstar. Police say he was employed in construction for a while and there would have been enough work in the booming city for him. \n \n In August, after the White House incident, Reinking told police in Tazewell County, Illinois, that he wanted to file a report about 20 to 30 people tapping into his computer and phone. He also complained that people were \"barking like dogs\" outside his residence, according to a report. \n \n Reinking agreed to go to a local hospital for an evaluation after repeatedly resisting the request, the report said. \n \n Another report from the sheriff's office said Reinking barged into a community pool in Tremont, Illinois, last June and jumped into the water wearing a pink woman's coat over his underwear. Investigators believed he had an AR-15 rifle in his car trunk, but it was never displayed. No charges were filed. \n \n Reinking was not armed when he was detained near the White House. However, state police in Illinois, revoked his state firearms card at the request of the FBI and four guns were taken from him, authorities said. The AR-15 used in the shootings was among the firearms seized after U.S. Secret Service agents arrested him last July. \n \n Sheriff Robert Huston in Tazewell County, Illinois, said deputies allowed Reinking's father to take possession of the guns on the promise that he would \"keep the weapons secure and out of the possession of Travis.\" Huston added that, based on deputies' encounters with Reinking, \"there's certainly evidence that there's some sort of mental health issues involved.\" \n \n While Huston said it was unclear how Reinking reclaimed the guns, Nashville Police spokesman Don Aaron said that his father \"has now acknowledged giving them back.\" \n \n Phone calls to a number listed for the father, Jeffrey Reinking, went unanswered. \n \n Police recovered three of the four guns that were originally taken from Reinking, officials said. They believe he is armed with at least one handgun. \n \n Reinking, police said, drove into the Waffle House parking lot in his gold Chevy Silverado pickup and sat there for about four minutes before opening fire outside the restaurant. \n \n The victims fatally shot in the parking have been identified as Taurean Sanderlin, 29, of Goodlettsville, and Joe Perez, 20, of Nashville. \n \n Sanderlin was an employee at the restaurant. \n \n Perez's mother posted a picture of her son on Facebook and asked for prayers, saying it was the hardest day of her life. \"Me, my husband and sons are broken right now with this loss,\" Trisha Perez said in the post. \"Our lives are shattered.\" \n \n Reinking then went inside the restaurant and opened fire, police said. \n \n One of the fatally wounded inside was DeEbony Groves, a 21-year student at Nashville's Belmont University. \n \n Groves was remembered as an exceptional student who made the Dean's list and a tenacious basketball player. \n \n \"She was a brilliant young lady, very, very intelligent and a very hard worker,\" Gallatin High School basketball coach Kim Kendrick told The Tennessean. \n \n Akilah Dasilva was also killed inside the restaurant. The 23-year-old from Antioch was a rap artist and music video producer who had such skills behind the camera that he was a favorite among many of Music City's independent musicians and recording labels, The Tennessean reported. \n \n \"Music is my life and I will never stop until I achieve my dreams,\" Dasilva said on his Twitter account. \n \n Dasilva's mother told CBS News that her son was a student at Middle Tennessee State University and aspired to be a music engineer. \n \n He was at the restaurant with his girlfriend, 21-year-old Tia Waggoner, the paper reported. Waggoner was wounded and is being treated at Vanderbilt University Medical Center. \n \n Dasilva's family said she underwent surgery and doctors were trying to save her leg. \n \n Police say Sharita Henderson, 24, of Antioch, was wounded and is being treated at VUMC. \n \n Also wounded was James Shaw Jr., a 29-year-old restaurant patron, whom police said suffered minor wounds from wrestling the gun away Reinking. \n \n Shaw, who is a Nashville native who works as a wireless technician for AT&T, said he was no hero \u2014 despite being hailed as one by Nashville Mayor David Briley. \n \n Shaw said he pounced on the suspect after making up his mind that \"he was going to have to work to kill me.\" \n \n ___ \n \n Associated Press writers John Raby in Charleston, West Virginia; Ed White in Detroit; and Justin Pritchard in Los Angeles contributed to this report.",

According to police reports, relatives in Reinking's Illinois hometown say that since 2014, he has been having delusions that Taylor Swift is stalking him and dozens of unknown culprits are hacking into his phone and computer, the New York Daily News reports. According to a July 2016 police report from Peoria, Reinking told officers he had confronted the singer in a Dairy Queen parking lot. In his version of events, \"Taylor climbed up the side of a building and Travis followed. However, when he reached the rooftop, Taylor was gone.\" In other incidents the next year, after he moved to Nashville, Reinking allegedly threatened a man with a semi-automatic rifle and barged into a community pool and jumped in wearing a pink housecoat. Police say Reinking's weapons, including the AR-15 used to kill four people at the Waffle House, were seized after he was arrested outside the White House last year, the Tennessean reports. The weapons were given to Reinking's father after he promised to keep them away from his son. Police believe the father later gave the four firearms back to his son.

The brothers also killed a Massachusetts Institute of Technology police officer days later. \n \n In a message Tsarnaev scrawled inside a boat he hid in before he was captured, Tsarnaev said the attack was meant as retaliation against the U.S. for its actions in Muslim countries.

Gilbert received a life sentence. \n \n More than 20 bombing victims are expected to speak during Tsarnaev\u2019s sentencing hearing, including family members of those who died and people who were injured in the explosions. \n \n Bombing survivor Celeste Corcoran told WBZ that neither she nor her daughter Sydney, who was also injured, will be attending Tsarnaev\u2019s Wednesday sentencing. \n \n \u201cIt would only add stress to our lives and wouldn\u2019t make any impact on him,\u201d Celeste Corcoran said. \u201cHe is not worthy of our time or any more of our tears. To us, he is already dead.\u201d \n \n Hoose said he can\u2019t see any legal advantage for Tsarnaev to speak. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think there\u2019s anything to be gained by it at this point. Whatever would be said, I think, would be viewed as too little, too late,\u201d Hoose said. \n \n New York Law School professor Robert Blecker, a death penalty advocate, said any expression of remorse would not affect Tsarnaev\u2019s sentence or his planned appeal but could help him if he decides to seek a commutation of his death sentence from the president. \n \n \u201cIf he desperately wanted to save his life and he were willing to express it now and then show a consistent pattern of remorse and good behavior, he would significantly strengthen his case later on,\u201d Blecker said. \n \n President Bill Clinton commuted the sentence of David Ronald Chandler, the first person sentenced to death under the 1988 federal law that allowed capital punishment in drug-related killings. A gunman who said Chandler \u2014 an Alabama marijuana dealer \u2014 paid him $500 to kill another man later recanted his testimony. Clinton commuted his sentence to life without parole. \n \n Blecker said any speech by Tsarnaev would not jeopardize his appeal, which is likely to focus on an unsuccessful defense bid to move the trial because of the large number of people who knew someone connected to the marathon and the emotional impact the attack had in Massachusetts. \n \n The defense made it clear from the first day of the trial that its goal was not to win an acquittal but to save Tsarnaev\u2019s life. \u201cIt was him,\u201d attorney Judy Clarke said in opening statements, admitting Tsarnaev participated in the bombings. \n \n For Tsarnaev\u2019s lawyers, the danger of him speaking is that it could backfire if he makes a political statement seeking to justify the bombings. \n \n \u201cThere\u2019s no legal advantage to doing it, and I\u2019m sure he\u2019ll be advised not to,\u201d said Robert Sheketoff, a Boston attorney who represented Gary Lee Sampson, who was sentenced to death after carjacking and killing two Massachusetts men and killing a third man in New Hampshire in 2001. Sampson\u2019s death sentence was later overturned; he faces a new sentencing trial in September. \n \n Only three people have been executed under the federal death penalty since it was reinstated in 1988, including Oklahoma City bomber Timothy McVeigh. \n \n In a brief statement during his sentencing hearing, McVeigh didn\u2019t express remorse but instead quoted a dissenting opinion written by Supreme Court Justice Louis Brandeis in a wiretapping case: \u201cOur Government is the potent, the omnipresent teacher. For good or for ill, it teaches the whole people by its example.\u201d \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s all I have,\u201d McVeigh said. \n \n (TM and \u00a9 Copyright 2015 CBS Radio Inc. and its relevant subsidiaries.

        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 A nun says Dzhokhar Tsarnaev expressed remorse, while prosecutors played video of him giving the finger to a security camera. But today, secondhand narratives and hand gestures may give way to words straight out of the Boston Marathon bomber's mouth during his sentencing, NBC News reports. Although defense lawyers are mum, the will-he-or-won't-he question has set off a debate over whether it's a smart idea for him to vocalize, say, his motives or apologies to victims' families, as the Los Angeles Times suggests. The lawyer who defended Timothy McVeigh, for one, thinks Tsarnaev shouldn't talk. \"I would be very surprised if he speaks,\" he tells NBC. \"Generally, I don't advise clients to make a statement unless they are articulate and it ... doesn't sound like it was written by lawyers.\" Adds another defense attorney, \"I don't think there's anything to be gained by it at this point,\" he says. \"Whatever would be said \u2026 would be viewed as too little, too late.\" But a law school prof tells CBS that Tsarnaev could take a long view: While an apology won't affect his sentence, it could give him leverage if he seeks to have his death sentence commuted by the president. Conversely, he could use his sentencing as a platform, like Zacarias Moussaoui, who issued taunts at his 2006 sentencing for conspiring on the 9/11 attacks: \"God curse America. And God save Osama bin Laden. You will never get him.\" Who will likely be speaking today: bombing victims and their families, who will have the chance to give impact statements, the Times notes. (Tsarnaev didn't testify at his trial, but he did cry during one person's testimony.)"
