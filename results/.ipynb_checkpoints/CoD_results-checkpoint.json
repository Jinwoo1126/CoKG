        "Summary": "The Gold King Mine spill turned the Animas River orange-brown. The EPA triggered the discharge. Durango stopped pumping water, and the sheriff closed the river. Residents watched the flow, which slowed through the Animas Valley, arriving after 8 p.m. About 1 million gallons of acidic water with heavy metals flowed into Cement Creek and the Animas River. Durango urged water conservation, monitored fish, and New Mexico took precautions. The water contained iron, zinc, and pH levels dropped.",
        "Document": "Acidic wastewater from an abandoned mine above Silverton coursed its way through La Plata County on Thursday, turning the Animas River orange-brown, forcing the city of Durango to stop pumping raw water from the river and persuading the sheriff to close the river to public use. \n \n Residents lined the banks of the Animas River on Thursday afternoon to watch the toxic wastewater as it flowed through Durango city limits. But the sludge slowed as it snaked its way through the oxbow in the Animas Valley, and the murk didn't arrive until after 8 p.m. \n \n The accident occurred about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Gold King Mine in San Juan County. A mining and safety team working on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency triggered the discharge, according to a news release issued by the EPA. \n \n The EPA's team was working with heavy equipment to secure and consolidate a safe way to enter the mine and access contaminated water, said Richard Mylott, a spokesman for the EPA in Denver. The project was intended to pump and treat the water and reduce metal pollution flowing out of the mine into Cement Creek, he said. \n \n The disaster released about 1 million gallons of acidic water containing sediment and metals flowing as an orange-colored discharge downstream through Cement Creek and into the Animas River. \n \n River closure \n \n The Animas River was closed to tubers, rafters and kayakers Thursday as the toxic plume made its way through Durango. The closure went into effect at 3 p.m., and it will remain in effect indefinitely until the river is deemed safe, said La Plata County Sheriff Sean Smith. Government officials aren't certain what toxins and at what levels toxins are present in the river, and, therefore, decided it was best to close the river to public use. \n \n The closure, which applies to all flotation devices, is in effect for the entire stretch of the Animas River in La Plata County. \n \n \u201cThis decision was made in the interest of public health after consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, San Juan Basin Health Department and representatives of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEPA test results of the Animas River are expected within 24-48 hours, and the order will be re-evaluated at that time.\u201d \n \n City to conserve water \n \n The city of Durango stopped pumping water out of the Animas River on Wednesday to prevent contaminating the city reservoir. \n \n The Animas is an important secondary source of water for the city during the summer, and residents need to conserve as much water as possible over the next few days until the water is safe to use, said Steve Salka, the city's utilities director. \n \n No formal water restrictions were issued. \n \n At south City Market, Sean Lumen, who was hoisting bottled water onto emptied shelves, said if customers continued to buy water at Thursday's rate, the store would run out sometime Friday. \n \n At Albertsons, front-end manager Shelley Osborn said she initially thought people were buying up bottled water at an unusually rapid rate because it was on sale. Aaron Memro, grocery manager, estimated Albertsons sold two pallets of water Thursday \u2013 far more than usual. \n \n During the emergency, Salka will not send raw water to Hillcrest Golf Club or Fort Lewis College for grounds use. The city also will not water any city-owned parks for the next three days to help conserve, he said. \n \n On hot summer days, the city can use up to 9.2 million gallons a day. But the city can pump only 5.3 million gallons a day out of the Florida River. \n \n The city reservoir was about 4.5 feet below capacity on Wednesday, Salka said. \n \n \u201cThis couldn't happen at a worse time for me, so I have to be really cautious,\u201d he said. \n \n Fish habitat \n \n The EPA downplayed the potential effects on aquatic life, saying there are long-standing water-quality impairment issues associated with heavy metals in Cement Creek and upper portions of the Animas River. As a result, there are no fish populations in the Cement Creek watershed, and fish populations have historically been impaired for several miles downstream of Silverton in the Animas River, the release said. \n \n Colorado Parks and Wildlife placed four cages containing fish in the Animas River to monitor what happens to them, said spokesman Joe Lewandowski. The cages were placed at 32nd Street, the fish hatchery, Dallabetta Park and the High Bridge. \n \n \u201cWe'll see if those fish survive,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cWe're also monitoring to make sure we don't get infiltration into the hatchery, because that could be a problem.\u201d \n \n Peter Butler, co-coordinator of the Animas River Stakeholders Group and former chairman of the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission, said it remains to be seen whether the toxic metal concentrations flowing downriver will impact the few fish species living below Bakers Bridge. But if the plume does have a negative impact on aquatic life, Butler estimated that fish would die within hours of contact with the plume. \n \n The contaminated water made its way to Bakers Bridge in La Plata County by Thursday morning and hit town by Thursday evening. The material was expected to cross the New Mexico state line between 4 and 5 a.m. Friday and arrive in Farmington on Friday evening. \n \n Farmington city officials shut down all water-supply intake pumps to avoid contamination and advised citizens to stay out of the river until the discoloration has passed. \n \n Local officials asked all agricultural water users to shut off water intakes. \n \n What's in the water? \n \n Butler said the water being discharged from Gold King carried high concentrations of iron, aluminum, cadmium, zinc and copper. \n \n While he didn't know precisely the metal levels in the water that surged out of Gold King on Wednesday, Butler said: \u201cI'm sure they were really high.\u201d \n \n Though Gold King has no record of emitting mercury, Butler said \u201cwhen old mines open up like that, mercury sometimes drains out. Possibly, some other metals might have been released, like lead and arsenic. But there's no evidence of that at this point.\u201d \n \n Butler said Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety scientist Kirstin Brown had tested pH levels \u2013 the telltale measure of acidity in water \u2013 in the Animas River at Trimble Lane when the toxic plume arrived. \n \n The pH level dropped from 7.8 to 5.8. \n \n \u201cThat's a pretty big drop,\u201d Butler said. \n \n Silverton does not use water from Cement Creek, so its water source remained uncontaminated, said William Tookey, the San Juan County administrator who met Thursday with EPA officials. \n \n The Animas River was looking healthier about 24 hours after the discharge in Silverton, he said. \n \n Gold King problems \n \n This is not the first time there has been a water-related accident at one of the mines, but it did come as a surprise to the town, Tookey said. \n \n He was not sure if the release would change attitudes toward the EPA in town. For years, some town residents and local officials have been opposed to a Superfund listing. \n \n \u201cSince it was the EPA that was responsible for this, it may make people less likely to be open to them,\u201d he said. \n \n Butler said everyone invested in improving the Animas River's water quality wanted to get into Gold King, because, for years, it has been one of the two biggest contributors of heavy-metal loads in the Animas Basin. \n \n \u201cThey had a plan for handling the mine pool, but something went wrong, and it all came blowing out,\u201d Butler said. \n \n EPA teams will be sampling and investigating downstream locations over the next several days to confirm the release has passed and poses no additional concerns for aquatic life or water users. ||||| DENVER (AP) \u2014 A plume of orange-ish muck from million-gallon mine waste spill in Colorado was headed down river to New Mexico, prompting communities along the water route to take precautions until the sludge passes. \n \n People kayak in the Animas River near Durango, Colo., Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015, in water colored from a mine waste spill.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that a cleanup... (Associated Press) \n \n Officials emphasized that there was no threat to drinking water from the spill. But downstream water agencies were warned to avoid Animas River water until the plume passes, said David Ostrander, director of the EPA's emergency response program in Denver. \n \n The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that a cleanup team was working with heavy equipment Wednesday to secure an entrance to the Gold King Mine in southwest Colorado. Workers instead released an estimated 1 million gallons of mine waste into Cement Creek. \n \n \"The project was intended to pump and treat the water and reduce metals pollution flowing out of the mine,\" agency spokesman Rich Mylott said in a statement. \n \n The creek runs into the Animas, which then flows into the San Juan River in New Mexico and joins the Colorado River in Utah. \n \n Officials weren't sure how long it would take the plume to dissipate, Ostrander said. The acidic sludge is made of heavy metal and soil, which could irritate the skin, he said. \n \n The EPA was testing the plume to see which metals were released. Previous contamination from the mine sent iron, aluminum, cadmium, zinc and copper into the water, said Peter Butler, co-coordinator of the Animas River Stakeholders Group. \n \n Earlier Thursday, the EPA said in a statement that the polluted water \"was held behind unconsolidated debris near an abandoned mine portal.\" \n \n As the plume headed toward New Mexico, that state's governor said the EPA waited too long to tell her about the problem. \n \n Gov. Susana Martinez is disturbed by the lack of information provided by the agency to New Mexico's environmental agencies, said Chris Sanchez, a spokesman for the governor. Sanchez said that the state was not told of the spill until almost a full day after it happened. \n \n The plume made its way to Durango on Thursday afternoon, prompting La Plata County health officials to warn rafters and others to avoid the water. The scenic waterway was the backdrop for parts of the movie \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and is popular with summer boaters. \n \n Durango stopped pumping water out of the Animas River on Wednesday to make sure none of the waste could be sucked up into the city reservoir. It also suspended the transfers of raw water to a local golf course and Fort Lewis College. Pet owners were advised to keep dogs and livestock out of the Animas. \n \n \"It's really, really ugly,\" Butch Knowlton, La Plata County's director of emergency preparedness, told The Durango Herald. \"Any kind of recreational activity on the river needs to be suspended.\" \n \n In Farmington, New Mexico, city officials shut down water-supply intake pumps to avoid contamination and advised citizens to stay out of the river until the discoloration has passed. Don Cooper, emergency manager in San Juan County, said people should not panic because the EPA had told the county the spill would not harm people and that the primary pollutants were iron and zinc. \n \n \"It's not going to look pretty, but it's not a killer,\" Cooper told The (Farmington) Daily Times. \n \n The impact on wildlife wasn't clear. There are no fish in the Cement Creek watershed because of longstanding problems with water quality, the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment said. \n \n Colorado Parks and Wildlife was placing cages containing fish in the Animas River to monitor what happens to them, spokesman Joe Lewandowski said. \n \n \"We'll see if those fish survive,\" Lewandowski said. \"We're also monitoring to make sure we don't get infiltration into the hatchery, because that could be a problem.\" \n \n The U.S. Fish & Wildlife office in suburban Denver did not immediately return a call asking about the spill. \n \n Durango resident Lisa Shaefer said she was near the mine Wednesday when a mine bulwark broke and sent a torrent of water downstream that raised the water level 2 to 3 feet in Cement Creek. The initial wall of water carried rocks and debris and made a roar as it pushed through a culvert, she said. \n \n \"What came down was the filthiest yellow mustard water you've ever seen,\" she told the newspaper. \n \n ___ \n \n Information from: KIQX-FM, http://www.radiodurango.com ||||| About 1 million gallons of mine waste spilled into a Colorado waterway on Wednesday, turning the water bright orange and prompting officials to warn residents to avoid recreational use of the Animas River. \n \n San Juan County health officials say the Environmental Protection Agency and the state Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety were investigating another contamination when they \u201cunexpectedly triggered a large release of mine waste water into the upper portions of Cement Creek.\u201d Cement Creek is a tributary of the Animas River. \n \n Residents in parts of Colorado have been urged to cut back on water use and avoid the Animas River until officials are sure the river is free from contamination.

        "Document": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) \u2013 A Trader Joe\u2019s store assistant manager was killed by gunfire from Los Angeles police officers during a chase and shootout with a suspect in Silver Lake Saturday. \n \n LAPD Chief Michel Moore told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that investigators have determined that one of two officers accidentally shot 27-year-old Melyda Corado while engaging in a shootout with the suspect, 28-year-old Gene Evin Atkins. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry to report that we\u2019ve now determined through our forensic investigation, that one of the officers\u2019 rounds struck Ms. Corado as she was exiting the market and was in close proximity to Atkins,\u201d Moore said. \u201cMs. Corado ran back into the store and collapsed behind the manager\u2019s desk.\u201d \n \n According to Moore, Atkins\u2019 car had slammed into a light pole outside the entrance of the Trader Joe\u2019s, located in the 2700 block of Hyperion Avenue. \n \n Upon hearing the crash, Corado was one of several people who ran to the front door of the store, at the same time that an armed Akins himself ran towards the entrance. \n \n \u201cAs he did so, witness statements and physical evidence from the scene support that Atkins fired multiple rounds from a semiautomatic pistol at the officers,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThe two Los Angeles police officers who had been pursuing Atkins returned fire in defense of their lives and to protect Atkins from harming other individuals.\u201d \n \n The officers fired eight rounds in returning Atkins\u2019 gunshots, Moore said. \n \n The fatal bullet first hit Corado\u2019s arm, then entered her body. \n \n Atkins appeared in court Tuesday to face more than 30 charges, including one count of murder, six counts of attempted murder, 13 counts of false imprisonment of hostages and one count of felony evading. His arraignment was postponed to Aug. 14. His bail was set at $18.7 million. \n \n The slaying is attributed to Atkins even though he did not fire the fatal bullet because he is held to have caused the entire situation. \n \n Moore also released dash-cam video leading up to the chase. Watch it below. \n \n Before Saturday\u2019s shootout at Trader Joe\u2019s, Atkins allegedly shot and wounded his grandmother, who remains hospitalized, and 17-year-old girlfriend. He then led police on a chase, ending at the store. \n \n The Trader Joe\u2019s store remained closed Monday, while a memorial of signs and flowers in memory of Corado continued to grow outside the building. \n \n Although Atkins was booked on suspicion of murder, he could potentially face charges including attempted murder for the roughly 1:30 p.m. Saturday shooting of his 76-year-old grandmother \u2014 Mary Elizabeth Madison \u2014 in the home they shared in the 1600 block of East 32nd Street. Authorities said the woman was shot as many as seven times and remains hospitalized in critical condition. \n \n Atkins\u2019 cousin, Charleo Egland, said she didn\u2019t know exactly what prompted the shooting, but said the grandmother did not want Atkins\u2019 girlfriend in the home, and that likely led to a fight that ended with the shooting. \n \n Police said Atkins\u2019 girlfriend was also wounded in the shooting, and Atkins forced her into his grandmother\u2019s car then drove away with her in the passenger seat. \n \n Using a LoJack system, police traced the 2015 Toyota Camry sedan to the Hollywood area and gave chase, leading to Silver Lake, where Atkins crashed the Toyota into a power pole around 3:30 p.m. in front of the Trader Joe\u2019s supermarket, Moore said. \n \n Atkins got out of the car and ran into the store, firing toward officers as he ran, police said. \n \n A short time later, a woman now known to be Corado was seen being dragged away from the store\u2019s entryway and then unsuccessfully treated by paramedics trying to revive her. \n \n Moore said about 40 people were in the store when Atkins entered. As Atkins ran inside, employees and customers inside scrambled for cover. \n \n Some were seen escaping through a window toward the rear of the business and crawling down a ladder to safety. \n \n Police were also seen carrying several children away from the building. \n \n Atkins\u2019 girlfriend, who had been in the passenger seat of the Toyota when it crashed in front of the store, was taken to a hospital in fair condition. Fire officials described her as a 20-year-old woman. \n \n Police amassed outside the store, and around 5:30 p.m., at least three people who appeared to be customers came out of the store with their hands in the air \u2014 apparently hostages who were released or shoppers who had managed to elude the gunman. \n \n Atkins surrendered at about 6:30 p.m. He was taken to a hospital to be treated for a gunshot wound to his left arm. \n \n Margaret Stewart of the Los Angeles Fire Department said paramedics treated 10 people at the scene of the Trader Joe\u2019s, including Atkins, his girlfriend and Corado. A 12-year-old boy, a 41-year-old woman, a 70-year- old woman and an 81-year-old woman were hospitalized with minor injuries and listed in fair condition, Stewart said. Three other people were evaluated, but declined to be taken to hospitals. \n \n Moore returned to the crime scene Tuesday to be among the mourners. \n \n \u201cThis is about, frankly, an opportunity to pay some respects to a family and to a loss,\u201d Moore said, appearing to become emotional at times. \u201cThis young lady, by every description, had so much to live for, and to a father that has lost, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s (indescribable).\u201d \n \n Reaction to the revelation that officers had accidentally killed Corado was mixed. \n \n \u201cI kind of blame the police because they were shooting directly towards the store,\u201d nearby business owner Peter Hakopyan said. \n \n Hakopyan told CBS2 he knew Corado and witnessed the shootout. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a grocery, and there\u2019s people around,\u201d Hakopyan added. \u201cI would think the police would have more restraint.\u201d \n \n Still, some appreciated the precarious situation in which the officers found themselves. \n \n \u201cThe police did what they felt they had to do in the moment. They couldn\u2019t know,\u201d said longtime Silver Lake resident Miranda Birch. \u201cI think it\u2019s tragic, but I think it\u2019s a mistake to blame the police.\u201d \n \n A GoFundMe page set up to help cover Corado\u2019s funeral expenses had raised nearly $25,000 as of midday Monday. \n \n (\u00a92018 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

Moore said Gene Atkins, 28, shot his grandmother several times and ultimately led police on a chase that ended when his vehicle crashed into a pole outside the grocery store. Moore said Atkins fired at cops as he ran toward the entrance; Corado had come to the same entrance upon hearing the crash and was struck in her left arm in the process. The bullet entered her body. \"Miss Corado ran back inside the store and collapsed behind the manager\u2019s desk,\" Moore said, per the Los Angeles Times.
