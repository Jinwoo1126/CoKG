        "summary": "A mining accident at the Gold King Mine in San Juan County, Colorado, triggered by an Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) team, released about 1 million gallons of acidic wastewater containing sediment and metals into Cement Creek, which then flowed into the Animas River. The spill turned the river orange-brown, leading to the closure of the river to public use and the cessation of water pumping by the city of Durango to prevent contamination of the city reservoir. Residents were urged to conserve water, and local officials took measures to monitor and mitigate the impact on aquatic life and water quality. The contaminated water was expected to reach New Mexico, prompting further precautions.",
        "Document": "Acidic wastewater from an abandoned mine above Silverton coursed its way through La Plata County on Thursday, turning the Animas River orange-brown, forcing the city of Durango to stop pumping raw water from the river and persuading the sheriff to close the river to public use. \n \n Residents lined the banks of the Animas River on Thursday afternoon to watch the toxic wastewater as it flowed through Durango city limits. But the sludge slowed as it snaked its way through the oxbow in the Animas Valley, and the murk didn't arrive until after 8 p.m. \n \n The accident occurred about 10:30 a.m. Wednesday at the Gold King Mine in San Juan County. A mining and safety team working on behalf of the Environmental Protection Agency triggered the discharge, according to a news release issued by the EPA. \n \n The EPA's team was working with heavy equipment to secure and consolidate a safe way to enter the mine and access contaminated water, said Richard Mylott, a spokesman for the EPA in Denver. The project was intended to pump and treat the water and reduce metal pollution flowing out of the mine into Cement Creek, he said. \n \n The disaster released about 1 million gallons of acidic water containing sediment and metals flowing as an orange-colored discharge downstream through Cement Creek and into the Animas River. \n \n River closure \n \n The Animas River was closed to tubers, rafters and kayakers Thursday as the toxic plume made its way through Durango. The closure went into effect at 3 p.m., and it will remain in effect indefinitely until the river is deemed safe, said La Plata County Sheriff Sean Smith. Government officials aren't certain what toxins and at what levels toxins are present in the river, and, therefore, decided it was best to close the river to public use. \n \n The closure, which applies to all flotation devices, is in effect for the entire stretch of the Animas River in La Plata County. \n \n \u201cThis decision was made in the interest of public health after consultation with the Environmental Protection Agency, the Colorado Department of Public Health and Environment, San Juan Basin Health Department and representatives of the Southern Ute Indian Tribe,\u201d Smith said. \u201cEPA test results of the Animas River are expected within 24-48 hours, and the order will be re-evaluated at that time.\u201d \n \n City to conserve water \n \n The city of Durango stopped pumping water out of the Animas River on Wednesday to prevent contaminating the city reservoir. \n \n The Animas is an important secondary source of water for the city during the summer, and residents need to conserve as much water as possible over the next few days until the water is safe to use, said Steve Salka, the city's utilities director. \n \n No formal water restrictions were issued. \n \n At south City Market, Sean Lumen, who was hoisting bottled water onto emptied shelves, said if customers continued to buy water at Thursday's rate, the store would run out sometime Friday. \n \n At Albertsons, front-end manager Shelley Osborn said she initially thought people were buying up bottled water at an unusually rapid rate because it was on sale. Aaron Memro, grocery manager, estimated Albertsons sold two pallets of water Thursday \u2013 far more than usual. \n \n During the emergency, Salka will not send raw water to Hillcrest Golf Club or Fort Lewis College for grounds use. The city also will not water any city-owned parks for the next three days to help conserve, he said. \n \n On hot summer days, the city can use up to 9.2 million gallons a day. But the city can pump only 5.3 million gallons a day out of the Florida River. \n \n The city reservoir was about 4.5 feet below capacity on Wednesday, Salka said. \n \n \u201cThis couldn't happen at a worse time for me, so I have to be really cautious,\u201d he said. \n \n Fish habitat \n \n The EPA downplayed the potential effects on aquatic life, saying there are long-standing water-quality impairment issues associated with heavy metals in Cement Creek and upper portions of the Animas River. As a result, there are no fish populations in the Cement Creek watershed, and fish populations have historically been impaired for several miles downstream of Silverton in the Animas River, the release said. \n \n Colorado Parks and Wildlife placed four cages containing fish in the Animas River to monitor what happens to them, said spokesman Joe Lewandowski. The cages were placed at 32nd Street, the fish hatchery, Dallabetta Park and the High Bridge. \n \n \u201cWe'll see if those fish survive,\u201d Lewandowski said. \u201cWe're also monitoring to make sure we don't get infiltration into the hatchery, because that could be a problem.\u201d \n \n Peter Butler, co-coordinator of the Animas River Stakeholders Group and former chairman of the Colorado Water Quality Control Commission, said it remains to be seen whether the toxic metal concentrations flowing downriver will impact the few fish species living below Bakers Bridge. But if the plume does have a negative impact on aquatic life, Butler estimated that fish would die within hours of contact with the plume. \n \n The contaminated water made its way to Bakers Bridge in La Plata County by Thursday morning and hit town by Thursday evening. The material was expected to cross the New Mexico state line between 4 and 5 a.m. Friday and arrive in Farmington on Friday evening. \n \n Farmington city officials shut down all water-supply intake pumps to avoid contamination and advised citizens to stay out of the river until the discoloration has passed. \n \n Local officials asked all agricultural water users to shut off water intakes. \n \n What's in the water? \n \n Butler said the water being discharged from Gold King carried high concentrations of iron, aluminum, cadmium, zinc and copper. \n \n While he didn't know precisely the metal levels in the water that surged out of Gold King on Wednesday, Butler said: \u201cI'm sure they were really high.\u201d \n \n Though Gold King has no record of emitting mercury, Butler said \u201cwhen old mines open up like that, mercury sometimes drains out. Possibly, some other metals might have been released, like lead and arsenic. But there's no evidence of that at this point.\u201d \n \n Butler said Colorado Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety scientist Kirstin Brown had tested pH levels \u2013 the telltale measure of acidity in water \u2013 in the Animas River at Trimble Lane when the toxic plume arrived. \n \n The pH level dropped from 7.8 to 5.8. \n \n \u201cThat's a pretty big drop,\u201d Butler said. \n \n Silverton does not use water from Cement Creek, so its water source remained uncontaminated, said William Tookey, the San Juan County administrator who met Thursday with EPA officials. \n \n The Animas River was looking healthier about 24 hours after the discharge in Silverton, he said. \n \n Gold King problems \n \n This is not the first time there has been a water-related accident at one of the mines, but it did come as a surprise to the town, Tookey said. \n \n He was not sure if the release would change attitudes toward the EPA in town. For years, some town residents and local officials have been opposed to a Superfund listing. \n \n \u201cSince it was the EPA that was responsible for this, it may make people less likely to be open to them,\u201d he said. \n \n Butler said everyone invested in improving the Animas River's water quality wanted to get into Gold King, because, for years, it has been one of the two biggest contributors of heavy-metal loads in the Animas Basin. \n \n \u201cThey had a plan for handling the mine pool, but something went wrong, and it all came blowing out,\u201d Butler said. \n \n EPA teams will be sampling and investigating downstream locations over the next several days to confirm the release has passed and poses no additional concerns for aquatic life or water users. ||||| DENVER (AP) \u2014 A plume of orange-ish muck from million-gallon mine waste spill in Colorado was headed down river to New Mexico, prompting communities along the water route to take precautions until the sludge passes. \n \n People kayak in the Animas River near Durango, Colo., Thursday, Aug. 6, 2015, in water colored from a mine waste spill.

The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that a cleanup... (Associated Press) \n \n Officials emphasized that there was no threat to drinking water from the spill. But downstream water agencies were warned to avoid Animas River water until the plume passes, said David Ostrander, director of the EPA's emergency response program in Denver. \n \n The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency said that a cleanup team was working with heavy equipment Wednesday to secure an entrance to the Gold King Mine in southwest Colorado. Workers instead released an estimated 1 million gallons of mine waste into Cement Creek. \n \n \"The project was intended to pump and treat the water and reduce metals pollution flowing out of the mine,\" agency spokesman Rich Mylott said in a statement. \n \n The creek runs into the Animas, which then flows into the San Juan River in New Mexico and joins the Colorado River in Utah. \n \n Officials weren't sure how long it would take the plume to dissipate, Ostrander said. The acidic sludge is made of heavy metal and soil, which could irritate the skin, he said. \n \n The EPA was testing the plume to see which metals were released. Previous contamination from the mine sent iron, aluminum, cadmium, zinc and copper into the water, said Peter Butler, co-coordinator of the Animas River Stakeholders Group. \n \n Earlier Thursday, the EPA said in a statement that the polluted water \"was held behind unconsolidated debris near an abandoned mine portal.\" \n \n As the plume headed toward New Mexico, that state's governor said the EPA waited too long to tell her about the problem. \n \n Gov. Susana Martinez is disturbed by the lack of information provided by the agency to New Mexico's environmental agencies, said Chris Sanchez, a spokesman for the governor. Sanchez said that the state was not told of the spill until almost a full day after it happened. \n \n The plume made its way to Durango on Thursday afternoon, prompting La Plata County health officials to warn rafters and others to avoid the water. The scenic waterway was the backdrop for parts of the movie \"Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid\" and is popular with summer boaters. \n \n Durango stopped pumping water out of the Animas River on Wednesday to make sure none of the waste could be sucked up into the city reservoir. It also suspended the transfers of raw water to a local golf course and Fort Lewis College. Pet owners were advised to keep dogs and livestock out of the Animas. \n \n \"It's really, really ugly,\" Butch Knowlton, La Plata County's director of emergency preparedness, told The Durango Herald. \"Any kind of recreational activity on the river needs to be suspended.\" \n \n In Farmington, New Mexico, city officials shut down water-supply intake pumps to avoid contamination and advised citizens to stay out of the river until the discoloration has passed. Don Cooper, emergency manager in San Juan County, said people should not panic because the EPA had told the county the spill would not harm people and that the primary pollutants were iron and zinc. \n \n \"It's not going to look pretty, but it's not a killer,\" Cooper told The (Farmington) Daily Times. \n \n The impact on wildlife wasn't clear. There are no fish in the Cement Creek watershed because of longstanding problems with water quality, the Colorado Department of Public Health and the Environment said. \n \n Colorado Parks and Wildlife was placing cages containing fish in the Animas River to monitor what happens to them, spokesman Joe Lewandowski said. \n \n \"We'll see if those fish survive,\" Lewandowski said. \"We're also monitoring to make sure we don't get infiltration into the hatchery, because that could be a problem.\" \n \n The U.S. Fish & Wildlife office in suburban Denver did not immediately return a call asking about the spill. \n \n Durango resident Lisa Shaefer said she was near the mine Wednesday when a mine bulwark broke and sent a torrent of water downstream that raised the water level 2 to 3 feet in Cement Creek. The initial wall of water carried rocks and debris and made a roar as it pushed through a culvert, she said. \n \n \"What came down was the filthiest yellow mustard water you've ever seen,\" she told the newspaper. \n \n ___ \n \n Information from: KIQX-FM, http://www.radiodurango.com ||||| About 1 million gallons of mine waste spilled into a Colorado waterway on Wednesday, turning the water bright orange and prompting officials to warn residents to avoid recreational use of the Animas River. \n \n San Juan County health officials say the Environmental Protection Agency and the state Division of Reclamation, Mining and Safety were investigating another contamination when they \u201cunexpectedly triggered a large release of mine waste water into the upper portions of Cement Creek.\u201d Cement Creek is a tributary of the Animas River. \n \n Residents in parts of Colorado have been urged to cut back on water use and avoid the Animas River until officials are sure the river is free from contamination.

Officials have placed cages of fish in the river to identify any ill effects and are testing the water to identify the specific metals released. An expert guesses the water contains high concentrations of iron, aluminum, cadmium, zinc, and copper, based on previous contamination.

        "Document": "LOS ANGELES (CBSLA) \u2013 A Trader Joe\u2019s store assistant manager was killed by gunfire from Los Angeles police officers during a chase and shootout with a suspect in Silver Lake Saturday. \n \n LAPD Chief Michel Moore told reporters at a news conference Tuesday that investigators have determined that one of two officers accidentally shot 27-year-old Melyda Corado while engaging in a shootout with the suspect, 28-year-old Gene Evin Atkins. \n \n \u201cI\u2019m sorry to report that we\u2019ve now determined through our forensic investigation, that one of the officers\u2019 rounds struck Ms. Corado as she was exiting the market and was in close proximity to Atkins,\u201d Moore said. \u201cMs. Corado ran back into the store and collapsed behind the manager\u2019s desk.\u201d \n \n According to Moore, Atkins\u2019 car had slammed into a light pole outside the entrance of the Trader Joe\u2019s, located in the 2700 block of Hyperion Avenue. \n \n Upon hearing the crash, Corado was one of several people who ran to the front door of the store, at the same time that an armed Akins himself ran towards the entrance. \n \n \u201cAs he did so, witness statements and physical evidence from the scene support that Atkins fired multiple rounds from a semiautomatic pistol at the officers,\u201d Moore said. \u201cThe two Los Angeles police officers who had been pursuing Atkins returned fire in defense of their lives and to protect Atkins from harming other individuals.\u201d \n \n The officers fired eight rounds in returning Atkins\u2019 gunshots, Moore said. \n \n The fatal bullet first hit Corado\u2019s arm, then entered her body. \n \n Atkins appeared in court Tuesday to face more than 30 charges, including one count of murder, six counts of attempted murder, 13 counts of false imprisonment of hostages and one count of felony evading. His arraignment was postponed to Aug. 14. His bail was set at $18.7 million. \n \n The slaying is attributed to Atkins even though he did not fire the fatal bullet because he is held to have caused the entire situation. \n \n Moore also released dash-cam video leading up to the chase. Watch it below. \n \n Before Saturday\u2019s shootout at Trader Joe\u2019s, Atkins allegedly shot and wounded his grandmother, who remains hospitalized, and 17-year-old girlfriend. He then led police on a chase, ending at the store. \n \n The Trader Joe\u2019s store remained closed Monday, while a memorial of signs and flowers in memory of Corado continued to grow outside the building. \n \n Although Atkins was booked on suspicion of murder, he could potentially face charges including attempted murder for the roughly 1:30 p.m. Saturday shooting of his 76-year-old grandmother \u2014 Mary Elizabeth Madison \u2014 in the home they shared in the 1600 block of East 32nd Street. Authorities said the woman was shot as many as seven times and remains hospitalized in critical condition. \n \n Atkins\u2019 cousin, Charleo Egland, said she didn\u2019t know exactly what prompted the shooting, but said the grandmother did not want Atkins\u2019 girlfriend in the home, and that likely led to a fight that ended with the shooting. \n \n Police said Atkins\u2019 girlfriend was also wounded in the shooting, and Atkins forced her into his grandmother\u2019s car then drove away with her in the passenger seat. \n \n Using a LoJack system, police traced the 2015 Toyota Camry sedan to the Hollywood area and gave chase, leading to Silver Lake, where Atkins crashed the Toyota into a power pole around 3:30 p.m. in front of the Trader Joe\u2019s supermarket, Moore said. \n \n Atkins got out of the car and ran into the store, firing toward officers as he ran, police said. \n \n A short time later, a woman now known to be Corado was seen being dragged away from the store\u2019s entryway and then unsuccessfully treated by paramedics trying to revive her. \n \n Moore said about 40 people were in the store when Atkins entered. As Atkins ran inside, employees and customers inside scrambled for cover. \n \n Some were seen escaping through a window toward the rear of the business and crawling down a ladder to safety. \n \n Police were also seen carrying several children away from the building. \n \n Atkins\u2019 girlfriend, who had been in the passenger seat of the Toyota when it crashed in front of the store, was taken to a hospital in fair condition. Fire officials described her as a 20-year-old woman. \n \n Police amassed outside the store, and around 5:30 p.m., at least three people who appeared to be customers came out of the store with their hands in the air \u2014 apparently hostages who were released or shoppers who had managed to elude the gunman. \n \n Atkins surrendered at about 6:30 p.m. He was taken to a hospital to be treated for a gunshot wound to his left arm. \n \n Margaret Stewart of the Los Angeles Fire Department said paramedics treated 10 people at the scene of the Trader Joe\u2019s, including Atkins, his girlfriend and Corado. A 12-year-old boy, a 41-year-old woman, a 70-year- old woman and an 81-year-old woman were hospitalized with minor injuries and listed in fair condition, Stewart said. Three other people were evaluated, but declined to be taken to hospitals. \n \n Moore returned to the crime scene Tuesday to be among the mourners. \n \n \u201cThis is about, frankly, an opportunity to pay some respects to a family and to a loss,\u201d Moore said, appearing to become emotional at times. \u201cThis young lady, by every description, had so much to live for, and to a father that has lost, I\u2019m sure it\u2019s (indescribable).\u201d \n \n Reaction to the revelation that officers had accidentally killed Corado was mixed. \n \n \u201cI kind of blame the police because they were shooting directly towards the store,\u201d nearby business owner Peter Hakopyan said. \n \n Hakopyan told CBS2 he knew Corado and witnessed the shootout. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s a grocery, and there\u2019s people around,\u201d Hakopyan added. \u201cI would think the police would have more restraint.\u201d \n \n Still, some appreciated the precarious situation in which the officers found themselves. \n \n \u201cThe police did what they felt they had to do in the moment. They couldn\u2019t know,\u201d said longtime Silver Lake resident Miranda Birch. \u201cI think it\u2019s tragic, but I think it\u2019s a mistake to blame the police.\u201d \n \n A GoFundMe page set up to help cover Corado\u2019s funeral expenses had raised nearly $25,000 as of midday Monday. \n \n (\u00a92018 CBS Local Media, a division of CBS Radio Inc.

But a State Department official said that the fact the money wasn't transferred on Jan. 1 doesn't mean it was frozen. \"There are still deliberations taking place, and we have until mid January to decide what we are going to do,\u201d the official said. \n \n The Trump administration has frozen $125 million in funding for the United Nations Relief and Works Agency, which provides aid to Palestinian refugees, according to three Western diplomats who were informed of the move. They said the funding, one third of the annual U.S. donations to the agency, was supposed to be transferred by Jan. 1 but was withheld. \n \n The details: The diplomats, who asked to speak on conditions of anonymity due to the sensitivity of the matter, said the funding was frozen until the Trump administration finishes its review of U.S. aid to the Palestinian Authority. \n \n The move comes after the Palestinian Authority suspended their contacts with the Trump administration in response to its decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel. A senior White House official said no decision have been made yet, but confirmed that a review of the U.S. assistance to the Palestinians is underway \"in light of the Palestinians' recent conduct.\" \n \n The diplomats added that U.S. officials told U.N. officials in the last two days that President Trump is considering totally cutting the part of the funding which was frozen, and is even considering cutting up to $180 million, which amounts to half of the U.S. funding to UNRWA. \n \n The impact: The Western diplomats said freezing or cutting of such a big part of the U.S. funding would be catastrophic for the organization, would hamper its work and might lead to negative consequences for the Palestinian refugee camps in Gaza, the West Bank, Jordan and Lebanon. \n \n U.N. secretary general Ant\u00f3nio Guterres has spoken with senior U.S. official about the UNRWA funding and also consulted with foreign ministers from other donor countries, according to the diplomats. \n \n The Israeli security establishment and the Coordinator of Government Activities in the Territories \u2014 the Israeli organization that oversees government activities in the West Bank and Gaza \u2014 are concerned about possible freezing or cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, fearing the escalation of the humanitarian crisis in Gaza. \n \n \u201cThe humanitarian situation in Gaza is complicated enough and harming UNRWA funding will only make it more complicated,\" a senior Israeli security official told me. \n \n What we're hearing: Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu is not enthusiastic about the cutting of U.S. funding to UNRWA, but is politically pressed by conservative ministers in his cabinet and by the fact he can't be more dovish on the Palestinian issue than President Trump. \n \n Officials in the prime minister's office told diplomats from several western countries that Israel does not object to the cutting of U.S. funding to the Palestinian Authority, but prefers that the U.S. doesn't cut funding to UNRWA due to the fact it also serves Israeli security interests. \n \n A senior Israeli official told me Netanyahu is in touch with the White House on the UNRWA funding issue, and conveyed the message that Israel prefers \u201cgradual disengagement\" with UNRWA by the U.S. and not a big funding cut. \n \n The prime minister's office said in a statement: \"Netanyahu supports President Trump's critical attitude towards UNRWA and believes practical steps need to be taken in order to change the fact that UNRWA is being used to entrench the Palestinian refugee problem instead of solving it.\" ||||| This is the full text of the Articles of Impeachment adopted by the House Judiciary Committee on July 27, 1974. \n \n Note: The articles of impeachment were passed only by the Committee on the Judiciary. They were never voted on in the full House of Representatives. Nixon was not impeached. \n \n Article 1 RESOLVED, That Richard M. Nixon, President of the United States, is impeached for high crimes and misdemeanours, and that the following articles of impeachment to be exhibited to the Senate: ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT EXHIBITED BY THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA IN THE NAME OF ITSELF AND OF ALL OF THE PEOPLE OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, AGAINST RICHARD M. NIXON, PRESIDENT OF THE UNITED STATES OF AMERICA, IN MAINTENANCE AND SUPPORT OF ITS IMPEACHMENT AGAINST HIM FOR HIGH CRIMES AND MISDEMEANOURS. ARTICLE 1 In his conduct of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in violation of his consitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice, in that: On June 17, 1972, and prior thereto, agents of the Committee for the Re-election of the President committed unlawful entry of the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee in Washington, District of Columbia, for the purpose of securing political intelligence. Subsequent thereto, Richard M. Nixon, using the powers of his high office, engaged personally and through his close subordinates and agents, in a course of conduct or plan designed to delay, impede, and obstruct the investigation of such illegal entry; to cover up, conceal and protect those responsible; and to conceal the existence and scope of other unlawful covert activities. The means used to implement this course of conduct or plan included one or more of the following: making false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; withholding relevant and material evidence or information from lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States; approving, condoning, acquiescing in, and counselling witnesses with respect to the giving of false or misleading statements to lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States and false or misleading testimony in duly instituted judicial and congressional proceedings; interfering or endeavouring to interfere with the conduct of investigations by the Department of Justice of the United States, the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, and Congressional Committees; approving, condoning, and acquiescing in, the surreptitious payment of substantial sums of money for the purpose of obtaining the silence or influencing the testimony of witnesses, potential witnesses or individuals who participated in such unlawful entry and other illegal activities; endeavouring to misuse the Central Intelligence Agency, an agency of the United States; disseminating information received from officers of the Department of Justice of the United States to subjects of investigations conducted by lawfully authorized investigative officers and employees of the United States, for the purpose of aiding and assisting such subjects in their attempts to avoid criminal liability; making or causing to be made false or misleading public statements for the purpose of deceiving the people of the United States into believing that a thorough and complete investigation had been conducted with respect to allegations of misconduct on the part of personnel of the executive branch of the United States and personnel of the Committee for the Re-election of the President, and that there was no involvement of such personnel in such misconduct: or endeavouring to cause prospective defendants, and individuals duly tried and convicted, to expect favoured treatment and consideration in return for their silence or false testimony, or rewarding individuals for their silence or false testimony. In all of this, Richard M. Nixon has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore Richard M. Nixon, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office. Adopted 27-11 by the Committee on the Judiciary of the House of Representatives, at 7.07pm on Saturday, 27th July, 1974, in Room 2141 of the Rayburn Office Building, Washington D.C. Listen to the roll call of the Judiciary Committee on the First Article of Impeachment: \n \n \n \n Listen to the Announcement of the Vote: \n \n \n \n Article 2 Using the powers of the office of President of the United States, Richard M. Nixon, in violation of his constitutional oath faithfully to execute the office of President of the United States and, to the best of his ability, preserve, protect, and defend the Constitution of the United States, and in disregard of his constitutional duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed, has repeatedly engaged in conduct violating the constitutional rights of citizens, impairing the due and proper administration of justice and the conduct of lawful inquiries, or contravening the laws governing agencies of the executive branch and the purposed of these agencies. This conduct has included one or more of the following: He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, endeavoured to obtain from the Internal Revenue Service, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, confidential information contained in income tax returns for purposed not authorized by law, and to cause, in violation of the constitutional rights of citizens, income tax audits or other income tax investigations to be intitiated or conducted in a discriminatory manner. He misused the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Secret Service, and other executive personnel, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, by directing or authorizing such agencies or personnel to conduct or continue electronic surveillance or other investigations for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; he did direct, authorize, or permit the use of information obtained thereby for purposes unrelated to national security, the enforcement of laws, or any other lawful function of his office; and he did direct the concealment of certain records made by the Federal Bureau of Investigation of electronic surveillance. He has, acting personally and through his subordinates and agents, in violation or disregard of the constitutional rights of citizens, authorized and permitted to be maintained a secret investigative unit within the office of the President, financed in part with money derived from campaign contributions, which unlawfully utilized the resources of the Central Intelligence Agency, engaged in covert and unlawful activities, and attempted to prejudice the constitutional right of an accused to a fair trial. He has failed to take care that the laws were faithfully executed by failing to act when he knew or had reason to know that his close subordinates endeavoured to impede and frustrate lawful inquiries by duly constituted executive, judicial and legislative entities concerning the unlawful entry into the headquarters of the Democratic National Committee, and the cover-up thereof, and concerning other unlawful activities including those relating to the confirmation of Richard Kleindienst as Attorney General of the United States, the electronic surveillance of private citizens, the break-in into the offices of Dr. Lewis Fielding, and the campaign financing practices of the Committee to Re-elect the President. In disregard of the rule of law, he knowingly misused the executive power by interfering with agencies of the executive branch, including the Federal Bureau of Investigation, the Criminal Division, and the Office of Watergate Special Prosecution Force, of the Department of Justice, and the Central Intelligence Agency, in violation of his duty to take care that the laws be faithfully executed. In all of this, Richard M. Nixon has acted in a manner contrary to his trust as President and subversive of constitutional government, to the great prejudice of the cause of law and justice and to the manifest injury of the people of the United States. Wherefore Richard M. Nixon, by such conduct, warrants impeachment and trial, and removal from office.

He added that Trump \"has every right to express his view of any case.\" \n \n The latter comment refers to Trump's tweets dismissing special counsel Robert Mueller's probe into the Trump campaign's alleged collusion with Russia during the 2016 election. Most recently, Michael Flynn, the president's former national security adviser and campaign aide, pleaded guilty on Friday to lying to the FBI, and one day later, Trump's Twitter account posted a comment that could help bolster a case of obstruction: \n \n \u201cI had to fire General Flynn because he lied to the Vice President and the FBI. He has pled guilty to those lies. It is a shame because his actions during the transition were lawful. There was nothing to hide!\u201d Trump posted, the first time he suggested he knew Flynn lied to investigators. \n \n The tweet could be seen as evidence of obstruction of justice because Trump later reportedly asked then-FBI Director James Comey to \u201clet\u201d the Flynn thing \u201cgo.\" \n \n Dowd said that he wrote the tweet. Not that it matters, because the president can't be found guilty of obstruction, the lawyer claims. \n \n It\u2019s not clear which section of the Constitution's Article II Dowd was referencing, though Section Two does read: \u201c The president] may require the Opinion, in writing, of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\u201d \n \n Keep up with this story and more by subscribing now \n \n But according to Dowd, the tweet was the furthest thing from an admission of guilt or obstruction. \n \n \"The tweet did not admit obstruction. That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion,\u201d Dowd told Axios. \n \n Dowd\u2019s comments hark back to former President Richard Nixon\u2019s defense of his actions in office. Nixon, who resigned in August 1974 before he could be impeached, famously said during his interviews with British journalist David Frost in 1977 that \u201cwhen the president does it, that means it is not illegal.\u201d \n \n REUTERS/James Lawler Duggan \n \n In Nixon\u2019s case, he was talking about the cover-up in the Watergate scandal, while Trump\u2019s case involves the president\u2019s powers over the Justice Department. Trump lamented in November that the \u201csaddest thing\u201d about being president is that he is \u201cnot supposed to be involved with the Justice Department\u201d and the \u201cFBI.\u201d \n \n Trump then asked why the Justice Department was not going after his former presidential opponent, Hillary Clinton, and her private email server scandal. He also wondered why the department was not investigating Clinton\u2019s campaign for hiring the company that created the infamous Trump-Russia dossier that has dogged Trump\u2019s first year in office.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 The Trump attorney who says he penned the \"sloppy\" tweet that some say indicates a possible obstruction of justice isn't done making headlines. John Dowd spoke to Axios' Mike Allen, scoffing at criticism of the tweet regarding Mike Flynn, which suggested Trump knew the former national security adviser had lied to the FBI before Trump canned James Comey. \"The tweet did not admit obstruction,\" Dowd says. \"That is an ignorant and arrogant assertion.\" Plus, the Constitution has Trump's back, per Dowd. \"[The] president cannot obstruct justice because he is the chief law enforcement officer under [the Constitution's Article II] and has every right to express his view of any case,\" he claims. Newsweek notes it's not clear which section of Article II Dowd refers to, though it speculates on one part involving the president seeking the opinion \"of the principal Officer in each of the executive Departments, upon any Subject relating to the Duties of their respective Offices.\" Allen notes that with this pronouncement, Trump's legal team is \"setting the stage\" to keep Trump insulated from obstruction of justice or collusion charges in the Russia probe\u2014meaning, Allen speculates, that his lawyers may be nervous charges are coming down the pike. But one of Barack Obama's former counsels notes \"it is certainly possible\" for Trump to have obstructed justice, and Allen points out Richard Nixon's Articles of Impeachment were jump-started with the assertion that Nixon \"has prevented, obstructed, and impeded the administration of justice.\" But whether Trump can or can't be held responsible for such a transgression may be moot, Allen adds. \"The one thing everyone agrees on is that the House of Representatives, with its impeachment power, alone decides what is cause for removal from office,\" he writes. \"For now, at least, the House is run by Republicans.\""

        "summary": "University of Virginia student Hannah Graham has been missing since September 13. Police are conducting extensive searches in Charlottesville and surrounding areas, urging property owners to report any unusual signs. Jesse L. Matthew Jr., the last person seen with Graham, has been charged with her abduction and was arrested in Texas after a nationwide manhunt. Matthew waived extradition and will be returned to Virginia to face charges. Despite efforts, Graham's whereabouts remain unknown, and a $100,000 reward is offered for information leading to her safe return.",
        "Document": "404 Not found \n \n \u2014 Police are asking property owners in this city and throughout nearby rural Albemarle County to look for any signs of missing University of Virginia student Hannah Graham, hoping that they can locate her after nearly two weeks of searching. \n \n Charlottesville Police Chief Timothy J. Longo said during a news conference Thursday that searchers have combed through most of this college town and are now moving south into surrounding farms and woodland. He also urged real estate agents and others to look in and around vacant homes and buildings in an effort to find the 18-year-old, who has been missing since Sept. 13. \n \n Longo said Graham had an iPhone 5S with a pink case that has not been found, and he said people should report anything they see that seems out of the ordinary on their properties, including unexpected tire tracks, clothing or other evidence that might help police find her. \n \n \u201cWe have no idea where she is, despite our best efforts,\u201d Longo said. \u201cEveryone realizes the more time that goes by, the more difficult this is going to come for everyone. I can\u2019t lose hope until I have to, until I need to, until it\u2019s appropriate to transition this into some other type of operation. I have hope, and I think Hannah\u2019s mom and dad have hope.\u201d \n \n Longo said in an interview Thursday that he wants anyone who knows Jesse L. \u201cLJ\u201d Matthew Jr., 32, who is charged with abducting Graham, to help identify spots that Matthew frequented. Police asked for help finding \u00adplaces where Matthew likes to fish, for example. A reward of $100,000 is being offered for information leading to the safe return of the 18-year-old U-Va. sophomore from Fairfax County. \n \n Charlottesville investigators arrived Thursday in Galveston, Tex., where Matthew appeared in court after he was arrested on a beach Wednesday afternoon. Longo said Charlottesville police will not approach Matthew about the case because he has invoked his right to consult with an attorney. Local authorities said they would try to speak with him late Thursday or early Friday, and they were searching his car for evidence. \n \n Matthew is the last person known to have seen Graham, and he has been charged with abduction with intent to sexually assault her. Police have not detailed what evidence they have against him. Matthew was taken into custody Wednesday in Texas after a widespread manhunt, and police said he will be extradited to Charlottesville to face charges in her disappearance. \n \n Early Thursday, Matthew appeared briefly in a Texas courtroom, where a judge denied bond and read Matthew his rights. Matthew declined a court- \n \n appointed attorney and waived an extradition hearing. \n \n Charlottesville lawyer James L. Camblos III, who is representing Matthew, said that he spoke to Matthew by phone late Wednesday, after his arrest. \n \n \u201cHe sounded okay considering the circumstances,\u201d Camblos said. \u201cHe called me from the jail and, under the circumstances, he sounded pretty good.\u201d \n \n Longo said it is unclear why Matthew was in the Galveston area, a popular summer destination on the Gulf of Mexico southeast of Houston and about 1,300 miles from Charlottesville. A Galveston County deputy found Matthew after the sheriff\u2019s office received a call from a woman who saw Matthew on the beach \u2014 in Gilchrist, on the Bolivar Peninsula \u2014 and found him suspicious. \n \n The deputy noticed that Matthew had set up a tent on the beach, sheriff\u2019s Capt. Barry Cook said. Matthew initially gave a false name, but the deputy ran the license plates on Matthew\u2019s car and discovered that he was wanted in Virginia, Cook said. Matthew was taken into custody without incident. \n \n [See a map of the region where Matthew was apprehended.] \n \n Galveston County Sheriff Henry Trochesset said Thursday that deputies have examined the car and surrounding sand dunes and will widen their search, but that they have no indication of where Graham might be. \n \n \u201cThis individual has a 1,300-mile track,\u201d the sheriff said, referring to Matthew\u2019s trip from Charlottesville to east Texas. \u201cThere\u2019s a lot of area to look at.\u201d \n \n It is unclear what ties, if any, Matthew might have to Texas. He grew up in the Charlottesville area and attended two Virginia universities \u2014 Liberty from 2000 to 2002 and then Christopher Newport in 2003. He played football at both schools and left both schools. Officials at the school would not discuss the circumstances of his departure, citing privacy rules. \n \n Also on Thursday, the owner of the restaurant where Graham was last seen said that Graham never entered the establishment with her alleged abductor, instead waiting outside for him while he purchased drinks. \n \n Brice Cunningham, owner of the upscale Tempo Restaurant in Charlottesville, said he saw Matthew for the first time at the restaurant late on Friday, Sept. 12, and then again during the early hours of Sept. 13. Cunningham said that Matthew drank shots of bourbon with two other customers about 11:45 p.m., and that he then saw Matthew enjoying music on the restaurant\u2019s dance floor. \n \n Cunningham said that Matthew, who was not a regular at the bar, appeared to be having a good time that evening. \n \n \u201cHe wasn\u2019t aggressive, he wasn\u2019t unpleasant,\u201d said Cunningham, 43. \u201cHe seemed friendly and was talking to people.\u201d \n \n Cunningham said that Matthew left the bar briefly and returned just after 1 a.m., closed a tab for two beers at 1:10 a.m. and then left sometime after that. He said that Tempo staffers, who were checking identification to ensure that patrons were at least 21 years old, saw Graham outside the bar and thought she appeared intoxicated. They saw her leave with Matthew on foot. \n \n \u201cNone of my staff saw her inside that night,\u201d Cunningham said in an interview Thursday. In a statement, Cunningham said that Graham was not served alcohol. \u201cShe was, however, noticed by the door person outside the restaurant at that time, and seen leaving with Matthew shortly thereafter.\u201d \n \n Graham had been seen on surveillance video walking with Matthew shortly after 1 a.m. on the city\u2019s Downtown Mall, headed in the direction of Tempo. Friends said her last text to them was at 1:06 a.m., just minutes before Matthew got to Tempo. The owner\u2019s account suggests that Graham arrived at the restaurant with Matthew, waited for him outside, and then left with him. \n \n The account differs from what police have said about Graham\u2019s interactions with Matthew at Tempo. Longo said Thursday that his investigators \u201chave at least one witness statement that puts Hannah Graham inside the bar with Mr. Matthew. You\u2019re always evaluating witness statements in an ongoing investigation, and we will be talking to folks again, but we have that statement.\u201d \n \n An extensive search has turned up almost no trace of Graham after she was seen at Tempo. Police have collected evidence from Matthew\u2019s car and apartment, and Longo said that prosecutors decided to press charges against Matthew after reviewing evidence from experts at the crime lab in Richmond. The charge against Matthew suggests that police believe Matthew took Graham against her will \u2014 or while she was in a state that left her unable to consent. \n \n Those close to Matthew, who is 6-foot-2 and weighs 270 pounds, have said they know him as a \u201cgentle giant\u201d who prayed at a local church, worked at the U-Va. hospital caring for patients and volunteered at the private Covenant School as a football coach. \n \n Flaherty and Jouvenal reported from Washington. ||||| Thank you for Reading. \n \n Please purchase a subscription to continue reading. \n \n A subscription is required to continue reading. \n \n Thank you for reading 5 free articles.

(Associated Press) \n \n Jill Howard, left, and her stepdaughter Martie Belt, talk about the arrest of Leroy Matthew Jr. as they walk along the beach Thursday, Sept. 25, 2014, near Gilchrist, Texas, on the Bolivar Peninsula.... (Associated Press) \n \n The island's beaches have served as a hiding spot for centuries: graves from one of the Houston area's most notorious mass slayings and a haven for the famed French pirate Jean Lafitte. \n \n \"We seem to be the end of the road,\" Sheriff Henry Trochesset said. \n \n Matthew was arrested Wednesday as a suspect in the abduction of University of Virginia student Hannah Graham. He waived extradition Thursday in Galveston. \n \n His arrest \u2014 initially for refusing to identify himself to authorities \u2014 came after a phone tip from a resident who saw the 6-foot-2, 270-pound man with dreadlocks and recognized him from TV. A deputy then spotted him camped out on the beach. \n \n It's not uncommon to see random tents on the barren beaches, nor for sheriff's deputies to encounter people who don't want to identify themselves, Trochesset said. \n \n \"We get lots of weird folks,\" Rob Faupel, 45, an air conditioning technician, said. \"It seems like a good place to seek refuge. It's kind of remote.\" \n \n Only one road leads to the peninsula from the mainland to the east, a two-lane state highway south of Interstate 10 that ends at the Gulf of Mexico and heads west toward Galveston. Repeated storms wiped out the old highway Texas 87 that bordered the seashore and led to Port Arthur and Beaumont at the far southeast corner of the state. Motorists coming from Galveston and Houston must take a 20-minute ferry ride across Galveston Bay. \n \n As far as the campers, beach maintenance crew member Cliff Reichel said, \"We don't bother them unless they flat out are doing something wrong.\" \n \n Reichel, 62, of Galveston, recalled one woman who was noteworthy because she had puppets on stakes outside her tent. She stayed for five months, then abruptly left. \n \n \"You get people who stay a month at a time, a week at a time,\" his partner, Jacob Huffstetler, 25, of nearby High Island, added. \n \n Becky Sosa, who works at Miss Nancy's Bait Camp in Gilchrist not far from the beach, agreed that Matthew might have easily gone unnoticed. \n \n \"He would fit right in,\" said the 54-year-old Sosa. \"We get some strange ones that come through here.

His 28-victim killing spree ended when accomplice Elmer Wayne Henley Jr. killed him in August 1973. \n \n \"It's kind of scary,\" Jill Howard, 56, of Arlington, said, recalling the infamous killings while walking the beach Thursday with her stepdaughter.

After a tip, police spotted Matthew camped out on a sliver of sand on the remote Bolivar Peninsula\u2014the site of a mass grave used decades ago by serial killer Dean Corll and accessible by a single road, the AP reports. Matthew is one of many to hole up on the spot (among others: famed French pirate Jean Lafitte, rumor has it), where some stay for months. \"We get lots of weird folks,\" says a local. \"It seems like a good place to seek refuge. It's kind of remote.\" More on the case from the Washington Post and the Daily Progress: Matthew initially said he was \"George Carr,\" but police discovered his true identity when they ran his car's plates. Authorities have searched the car, beach, and sand dunes. The case has brought to light another accusation against Matthew. An official has confirmed he was accused of raping a woman at Liberty University in 2002, but she didn't proceed with the case. He was a student there at the time. \"Basically, the woman was saying she hadn't consented and Matthew was saying she had,\" says an attorney with the Lynchburg Commonwealth Attorney's Office. Searchers have scoured much of Charlottesville, Va., and are moving on to surrounding farms and woodland. They've asked area real estate agents to inspect any vacant buildings or properties they represent, and have told the public to be on the lookout for Graham's iPhone 5S with a pink case or unexplained tire tracks. Authorities are also looking to identify some of Matthew's favorite fishing spots. Matthew has declined to fight his extradition, and Virginia police have been sent to retrieve him. He should arrive back in Charlottesville in a few days."

Zuber, and Department of Chemical Engineering head Paula Hammond, the David H. Koch Chair Professor in Engineering. The figures are Weinstock\u2019s playful way of boosting the visibility of scientists, in particular the work of female scientists. \n \n Now, a set of LEGOs Weinstock created celebrating the history of women at NASA is about to blast off. On Tuesday, LEGO announced that Weinstock\u2019s project, which spotlights five women who made historic contributions to the U.S. space program, has been selected to become an official LEGO set. \n \n \u201cWhat a wonderful way to celebrate the scientific achievements of these five pioneering women,\ufffd? says Zuber, the E.A. Griswold Professor of Geophysics and the first woman to lead a NASA planetary mission. \u201cAnd I\u2019m thrilled with the message that these LEGOs will send to girls \u2014 that they, too, can pursue their passions in science, technology, engineering, and math, and help make a better world.\ufffd? \n \n Last summer Weinstock submitted her concept, dubbed the Women of NASA, to LEGO Ideas, a platform that allows people around the world to propose new ideas for LEGO concepts. After a public voting period, during which Weinstock\u2019s set received 10,000 votes in 15 days, her project underwent an official LEGO review. \n \n Weinstock was inspired to create the set by her love of space and NASA, and her desire to showcase the contributions that women have made over the years to the field of space exploration. Above all, she hopes the set will help encourage more young girls to pursue STEM fields (science, technology, engineering, and math). \n \n \u201cI hope that \u2018Women of NASA\u2019 will be one little extra brick in the wall of trying to improve how women are perceived and shown in books, toys, and family programming,\ufffd? Weinstock explains. \u201cAnything I can do to help make sure girls understand that they can and should be interested in the sciences, engineering, and math, that is my goal. At the end of the day, that\u2019s why I am doing this.\ufffd? \n \n The set depicts five trailblazers in NASA\u2019s history: Margaret Hamilton, a computer scientist who led the development of software for the Apollo missions while at MIT; Mae Jemison, who became the first African-American woman in space in 1992; Katherine Johnson, known for calculating and verifying trajectories for the Mercury and Apollo programs; Sally Ride, who became the first American woman in space in 1983; and astronomer Nancy Grace Roman, one of the first female executives at NASA, who was instrumental in the planning of the Hubble Space Telescope. \n \n Weinstock explains that she wanted the set to feature \u201ca very diverse group of women in terms of what they did, in terms of their fields at NASA, in terms of their cultural backgrounds, and also in terms of their age. Some are shown as younger, but I made sure I had one shown as older. Also, most of the women in the set are known for their work in the space flight program at NASA, but I wanted to give a shout out to the astronomy program as well.\ufffd? \n \n Weinstock began creating LEGO figures back in 2009, when she constructed a LEGO likeness for her friend Carolyn Porco, a planetary scientist known for her imaging work on the Voyager and Cassini missions. After sharing an image of Porco\u2019s LEGO figurine on Twitter, Weinstock received an outpouring of positive feedback and was inspired to create more figures in an effort to help promote the work of living scientists. \n \n Since she built her first figurine, Weinstock has created LEGOs for a number of celebrated scientists and engineers, including primatologist Jane Goodall, oceanographer Sylvia Earle, physicist Stephen Hawking, and a number of MIT faculty members such as Ernest Moniz, professor of physics and special advisor to the president, and Sangeeta Bhatia, the John and Dorothy Wilson Professor of Health Sciences and Technology and Electrical Engineering and Computer Science and a member of MIT\u2019s Koch Institute for Integrative Cancer Research. \n \n \u201cBeing immortalized in LEGO is probably the coolest thing that has ever happened to me,\ufffd? Bhatia says. \u201cI hope it makes lots of little tinkerers dream about being engineers at MIT someday.\ufffd? \n \n Weinstock explains that she chose LEGOs as her medium as she feels \u201cthere is a childlike wonder to playing with a toy that you can make in people\u2019s likeness.\ufffd? \n \n \u201cOne major goal for me is to get the public to recognize the history of women in the STEM fields. I\u2019m hopeful that with this set more people will come to know these women,\ufffd? Weinstock says. \u201cPart of it is knowing these specific five women, but also part of it is setting an example. It\u2019s really important to set an example for girls, as well as for boys, to normalize and make plain that women are expected to be in these fields and that it\u2019s not strange or unusual.\ufffd?",

Concepts for potential sets can be posted on the site, and after the public votes (Weinstock, the deputy editor of MIT News, got 10,000 votes for her idea), Lego then reviews eligible projects. Weinstock says she not only wanted to give a nod to the history of women in STEM, but also to \"set an example\" for both girls and boys that it isn't \"strange or unusual\" for there to be females working as astronauts, computer programmers, or any other science or technology expert. Lego says more details on Weinstock's set, including how much it will cost and its release date, should be out later this year or in early 2018. (Cambridge is offering a Lego professorship.)"

Really not,\" said Cassavetes. \"And Ryan came to me, and there's 150 people standing in this big scene, and he says, 'Nick, come here.'

(Associated Press) \n \n MUNICH (AP) \u2014 Russia has proposed a March 1 ceasefire in Syria, U.S. officials say, but Washington believes Moscow is giving itself and the Syrian government three weeks to try to crush moderate rebel groups. \n \n The United States has countered with demands for the fighting to stop immediately, the officials said Wednesday. Peace talks are supposed to resume by Feb. 25. \n \n The talk of new ceasefire plans comes as the U.S., Russia and more than a dozen other countries meet in Munich to try to halt five years of civil war in the Arab country. The conflict has killed more than a quarter-million people, created Europe's biggest refugee crisis since World War II and allowed the Islamic State to carve out its own territory across parts of Syria and neighboring Iraq. \n \n Russia says it is supporting Syrian President Bashar Assad's government as part of a counterterrorism campaign. But the West says the majority of its strikes are targeting moderate groups that are opposed to Assad and the Islamic State. \n \n The most recent Russian-backed offensive, near Aleppo, prompted opposition groups to walk out of peace talks last month in Geneva, while forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee toward the Turkish border. \n \n The U.S. officials weren't authorized to speak publicly about private diplomatic discussions in the run-up to the Munich conference and demanded anonymity. One said the U.S. can't accept Russia's offer because opposition forces could suffer irreversible losses in northern and southern Syria before the ceasefire ever takes hold. \n \n The officials said the U.S. counterproposal is simple: A ceasefire that is effective immediately and is accompanied by full humanitarian access to Syria's besieged civilian centers. \n \n Secretary of State John Kerry, who arrived in Germany Wednesday, had talks planned late in the evening with U.N. peace envoy Staffan de Mistura and Adel al-Jubeir, the foreign minister of Saudi Arabia, a key backer of Syria's rebel groups. \n \n The Obama administration has been trying for months to clinch a ceasefire and pave the way for a transition government in Syria that would allow parties to the conflict to concentrate on defeating the threat posed by the Islamic State and the al-Qaida-linked Nusra Front. \n \n But after having long demanded Assad's ouster, the shift in the U.S. focus to combating terrorism has resulted in a confusing mix of priorities and a layered strategy in Syria that few understand, and even fewer see working. Beyond Russia, the administration has often struggled to keep its own allies such as Turkey and Saudi Arabia in line. \n \n \"We will approach this meeting in Munich with great hopes that this will be a telling moment,\" Kerry said Tuesday in Washington. His peace push coincides with Defense Secretary Ash Carter's attendance at a gathering in Brussels to hash out military options with NATO partners. \n \n Brett McGurk, the Obama administration's point-man for defeating the Islamic State, said Russia's Aleppo offensive was having the perverse effect of helping the extremists by drawing local fighters away from the battle against IS and to the war against Syria's government. \n \n \"What Russia's doing is directly enabling ISIL,\" McGurk told the House Foreign Affairs Committee in Washington. \n \n But the panel's top Democrat echoed some of the frustration of his Republican colleagues with the larger U.S. strategy. \n \n \"It seems as if we're only halfheartedly going after ISIS, and halfheartedly helping the (rebel) Free Syria Army and others on the ground,\" said Rep. Eliot Engel, D-N.Y. He urged a \"robust campaign, not a tentative one, not one that seems like we're dragging ourselves in ... to destroy ISIS and get rid of Assad.\" \n \n Kerry emphasized Tuesday that U.S. officials \"are not blind to what is happening.\" He said the Aleppo battle makes it \"much more difficult to be able to come to the table and to be able to have a serious conversation.\" \n \n But the U.S. has staked its hopes for an end to the five-year civil war in Syria on the peace talks and Assad's eventual departure, saying the American public has no appetite for a military solution. \n \n To that end, Washington has tempered its calls dating back to August 2011 for Assad to immediately leave power. And to get Russia on board, it now won't even say that Assad should be barred from running for re-election if and when a new Syrian constitution is drafted. \n \n The ambiguity has emboldened Assad's supporters, Russia and Iran, while upsetting American allies in the Middle East, who are frustrated by a process that appears to lock the Syrian leader in place well into 2017 \u2014 and perhaps beyond.",

The Guardian reports that according to a new study from the Syrian Center for Policy Research, the war has killed or injured 470,000 people\u201411.5% of the population\u2014and has also lowered life expectancy from 70 to 55 and almost \"completely obliterated\" the country's infrastructure. The most recent Russian-backed offensive, near Aleppo, prompted opposition groups to walk out of peace talks last month in Geneva, while forcing tens of thousands of civilians to flee toward the Turkish border. Sources tell the AP that the US can't accept Russia's offer of a March 1 ceasefire because moderate opposition forces could suffer irreversible losses in northern and southern Syria before it ever takes hold. Defense Secretary Ash Carter, meanwhile, says NATO military authorities have been ordered to draw up plans for how the alliance could help shut down illegal migration and people smuggling across the Aegean Sea. Three NATO allies\u2014Turkey, Germany, and Greece\u2014requested alliance participation in an international effort to help end Europe's gravest migration crisis since World War II."

West Virginia law does not require inspections for chemical storage facilities \u2014 only for production facilities. \n \n Some other states do require inspections of chemical storage facilities. Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said he was working with Randy Huffman, the secretary of the State Department of Environmental Protection, to come up with recommendations aimed at avoiding future leaks. \n \n The Charleston Gazette-Mail reported Sunday that a team of experts from the United States Chemical Safety Board asked the state three years ago to create a new program to prevent accidents and releases in the Kanawha Valley, known as Chemical Valley. \n \n That came after investigation of the August 2008 explosion and fire that killed two workers at the Bayer CropScience plant in Institute, W.Va. No program was produced, and another team from the same board is expected to arrive Monday to investigate this accident. \n \n Critics say the problems are widespread in a state where the coal and chemical industries, which drive much of West Virginia\u2019s economy and are powerful forces in the state\u2019s politics, have long pushed back against tight federal health, safety and environmental controls. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n \u201cWest Virginia has a pattern of resisting federal oversight and what they consider E.P.A. interference, and that really puts workers and the population at risk,\u201d said Jennifer Sass, a senior scientist at the Natural Resources Defense Council and a lecturer in environmental health at George Washington University. \n \n But Mr. Huffman disputed that accusation, noting that West Virginia\u2019s economy is more heavily dependent than other states on the coal and chemical industries. \u201cBased upon the types of industrial activity, how does it compare to the rest of the country? It\u2019s not in context.\u201d Although he added, \u201cThat\u2019s no excuse for any incident where someone gets hurt.\u201d \n \n Efforts to clean up the spill showed signs of improvement on Sunday. \n \n \u201cThe numbers look good, and like last night, they are very encouraging,\u201d Governor Tomblin said in a news conference on Sunday. \u201cI believe we\u2019re at a point where we can say we\u2019re seeing light at the end of the tunnel.\u201d \n \n Officials said tests conducted at a water treatment plant downstream from the site of the leak showed little to no traces of contamination on Sunday morning, allowing testing to move to the next phase. \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Advertisement Continue reading the main story \n \n Once the testing is complete, the water company plans to begin lifting the do-not-use ban by zones. The work will start in downtown Charleston and three other \u201cpriority zones\u201d that include the city\u2019s four major hospitals and 25,000 customers who use more than half of the company\u2019s water, said Jeff McIntyre, the president of West Virginia American Water. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t believe we\u2019re several days from starting the lift, but I\u2019m saying not today,\u201d Mr. McIntyre said. \n \n Government offices and many businesses planned to reopen on Monday, while many schools in the affected areas would remain closed, officials said. \n \n \u201cStores are open,\u201d said Jimmy Gianato, the state director of homeland security. \u201cWe\u2019re starting to get back to normal.\u201d \n \n Emergency rooms have treated about 169 patients for symptoms related to chemical exposure, said Karen Bowling, the state health secretary. Ten people were admitted to three hospitals with symptoms that were not life threatening, she said. \n \n The chemical in last Thursday\u2019s spill was 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, known as MCHM. The leak at the Elk River storage facility came from a ruptured tank storing this chemical, which is used to wash coal. \n \n No charges have been filed against Freedom Industries, the company that owns the plant, but the United States attorney\u2019s office has already begun an investigation into the spill. \n \n \u201cWhenever you have a discharge of a pollutant or a hazardous substance you have potential violation of the environmental laws,\u201d said Booth Goodwin, the United States attorney for the Southern District of West Virginia, according to a news report on WVVA.com. \n \n This is not the first chemical accident to hit West Virginia\u2019s Kanawha Valley. \n \n After an explosion at a West Virginia chemical plant owned by Bayer CropScience killed two employees in 2008, a 2010 congressional investigation found that managers refused for several hours to tell emergency responders the nature of the blast or the toxic chemical it released. It also found that they later misused a law intended to keep information from terrorists to try to stop federal investigators from learning what had happened. The plant manufactured the same chemical that was being processed at the time of a gas release in 1984 that killed 10,000 in Bhopal, India. \n \n West Virginia is also no stranger to accidents in the coal industry. \n \n In 2012, federal prosecutors charged David C. Hughart, a top executive at Massey Energy, a West Virginia coal operator, with a felony count and a second misdemeanor conspiracy count related to the deaths of 29 coal miners in a 2009 explosion at West Virginia\u2019s Upper Big Branch mine. Prosecutors said that Mr. Hughart and others knowingly conspired to violate safety laws at Massey\u2019s mines and worked to hide those violations by giving advance warnings of surprise inspections by the Mine Safety and Health Administration. \n \n In 2009, an investigation by The New York Times found that hundreds of workplaces in West Virginia had violated pollution laws without paying fines. In interviews at the time, current and former West Virginia Department of Environmental Protection employees said their enforcement efforts had been undermined by bureaucratic disorganization; a departmental preference to let polluters escape punishment if they promised to try harder; and a revolving door of regulators who left for higher-paying jobs at the companies they once policed. \n \n In June 2009, four environmental groups petitioned the E.P.A. to take over much of West Virginia\u2019s handling of the Clean Water Act, citing a \u201cnearly complete breakdown\u201d in the state. \n \n \u201cHistorically, there had been a questionable enforcement ethic,\u201d said Matthew Crum, a former state mining director at the state\u2019s Department of Environmental Protection. \n \n Cindy Rank, chairwoman of the West Virginia Highlands Conservancy\u2019s mining committee, said that the coal lobby has wielded great influence in crafting state environmental regulations. \u201cAccidents are always preventable. For the most part I think that\u2019s true in these disasters that keep happening,\u201d she said. She recalled negotiations over a groundwater protection bill from the early 1990s. \u201cWe swallowed hard and allowed the coal industry to get away with a lot in that bill,\u201d she said. ||||| Hundreds of thousands of West Virginia residents have gone more than four days without clean tap water after a chemical spill, though officials say that chemical readouts are returning to safe levels. NBC's Anne Thompson reports. \n \n The latest tests of poisoned water in West Virginia have shown that the quality is improving \u201cin the right direction,\u201d the state\u2019s governor said Sunday \u2014 a hopeful sign for the 300,000 residents currently under a strict tap water ban following a chemical spill four days ago. \n \n \"We are at a point where we can see a light at the end of the tunnel,\" Gov. Earl Ray Tomblin said at a news conference. \n \n But officials stopped short of saying when the do-not-use order would be lifted. \n \n \"I can tell you we\u2019re not several days from starting to lift, but I\u2019m not saying today,\" said Jeff McIntyre, president of West Virginia American Water, which runs the water treatment plant. \n \n The chemical spill first noticed Thursday on the Elk River has contaminated the water supply in the heart of the state, shutting down schools and businesses across nine counties, and forcing emergency agencies to truck in clean water to the Charleston region. \n \n Lt. Col. Greg Grant of the West Virginia National Guard said two tests Sunday morning at the treatment facility show the chemical\u2019s concentration at 0 parts-per-million for water going in and out of the plant. \n \n Before the all clear can be given once and for all, water sample test results must consistently show that the chemical\u2019s presence in the public water system is at or below 1 parts-per-million, the level recommended by federal agencies. \n \n \"That is a very encouraging and allows us to move forward\" with the next phase of sampling and testing, Grant said. \n \n Sixteen teams were collecting samples from affected areas in the region, and officials cautioned that the ban won\u2019t be lifted until results were in and the state health department signs off. Communities will be given the OK on a zone-by-zone basis. \n \n Marcus Constantino / The Daily Mail via AP Members of the West Virginia Army National Guard, along with a member of the Belle Police Department and a volunteer, offload emergency water from a military truck to a forklift as citizens line up Saturday for water at the Belle Fire Department in Belle, W.Va. \n \n West Virginia American Water is launching an online map to show which communities can begin using their tap water. The company will also autodial customers when the ban in their zone has been lifted. A hotline is also being made available to them. \n \n Schools will also be closed or partially closed in six counties Monday, although officials expect most students to be back in classrooms by Tuesday. \n \n The reliance on bottled water is taking its toll on frustrated residents who\u2019ve stripped stores and spent hours in long lines to collect water from tankers set up by the National Guard. Until the water is deemed safe, residents have been asked not to drink, bathe and cook with the tainted tap. \n \n The environmental emergency began Thursday morning, when the state Department of Environmental Protection began receiving complaints around 8:15 a.m. of a licorice-type odor in the tap water. It took three hours before officials found the source of the spill. \n \n The source turned out to be the chemical 4-methylcyclohexane methanol, which had leaked out of a 40,000-gallon tank at a Freedom Industries facility along the Elk River. \n \n Freedom Industries didn\u2019t report the leak to a spill hotline until 12:05 p.m. ET Thursday. \n \n State officials said Saturday they believe about 7,500 gallons leaked. Some of the chemical was contained before flowing into the river; it\u2019s not clear exactly how much entered the water supply. \n \n All told, 169 people have sought treatment at hospitals for symptoms such as nausea. Of those, 10 were admitted to three different hospitals, but their conditions weren\u2019t serious. \n \n Federal authorities, including the U.S. Chemical Safety Board, have opened an investigation into Thursday\u2019s spill. \n \n According to the state DEP, Freedom Industries is exempt from DEP inspections and permitting since it stores chemicals, and doesn\u2019t produce them. \n \n But the DEP ordered Freedom Industries to move its coal processing chemicals to a safer site and said it has 24 hours to start writing a plan on how it will clean up the spill and any soil contamination. \n \n The company did not take part in Sunday\u2019s news conference, and Gov. Tomblin said the state hasn\u2019t had much guidance from the company about the chemical in question. \n \n \"Perhaps they could have been a little bit more forthcoming to offer their assistance about what problems this particular chemical could cause,\" Tomblin said. \n \n Tomblin said he will work with his environmental agency chief on tightening regulation of chemical storage facilities in the current legislative session. \n \n Most visitors have cleared out of Charleston while locals are either staying home or driving out of the area to find a hot meal or a shower elsewhere. Orders not to use tap water for much other than flushing toilets mean that the spill is an emergency not just for the environment but for local businesses. \n \n Lisa Hechesky / Reuters Boats sit in the Elk River in front of the Freedom Industries plant in Charleston, W. Va., on Saturday. \n \n In downtown Charleston, the store Taylor Books usually fills the 40 seats in its cafe. But the cafe was shut down by the state Department of Health on Friday because it said employees had no way to safely wash their hands before serving customers. On Saturday only three people sat in the bookstore using the wireless Internet. \n \n Taylor Books' manager Dan Carlisle said he canceled a musician scheduled to play that night and the store was going to close five hours early. \n \n \u201cIt\u2019s pretty annoying,\u201d Carlisle said about Freedom Industries\u2019 response to the spill. \u201cI feel like you should just be honest with people immediately.\u201d \n \n In a statement issued Friday, Freedom Industries said that it was working with government agencies to contain the leak, and \u201cthe first priority was safety, containment and cleanup.\u201d \n \n The chemical spill has forced West Virginia's residents to examine the state's reliance on the coal and chemical industries. \n \n Coal is critical to the economy. Strong coal prices and demand proved vital to the state budget during and after the national recession, from 2009 through 2011. \n \n In Gov. Tomblin's recent State-of-the-State speech, he touted the chemical industry, saying it was among those that grew substantially over the last year. \n \n The spill that tainted the water supply involved a chemical used in coal processing. But it didn't involve a coal mine \u2014 and that's a point state officials are trying to convey to the public. \n \n When asked if the emergency is one of the risks of being a state that relies heavily on the coal industry, Tomblin quickly responded: \"This was not a coal company incident, this was a chemical company incident.\" \n \n \"It's used in processing coal, as I understand it, but obviously it was not a coal company, it was a chemical company that left the breach and the tanks that's holding this particular chemical,\" he said. \n \n The coal industry, too, was saying they should not bear the blame in this case. \n \n \"This is a chemical spill accident. It just so happens that the chemical has some applications to the coal industry, just that fact alone shouldn't cause people to point fingers at the coal industry,\" said Jason Bostic, vice president of the West Virginia Coal Association. \n \n The Associated Press contributed to this report.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 The chemical spill that has left more than 300,000 people in West Virginia without water appears to be the product of lax regulation in a state where coal and chemical firms have long operated with little oversight, the New York Times finds. A document released over the weekend reveals state authorities were aware that the company responsible was storing up to a million pounds of the coal-cleaning chemical Crude MCHM at a riverside facility near a water treatment plant, but it's not clear whether the treatment plant knew about the risk, reports the Wall Street Journal. \"We can\u2019t just point a single finger at this company,\" says the director of the West Virginia Rivers Coalition, noting that the site of the spill hadn't been inspected since 1991. \"We need to look at our entire system and give some serious thought to making some serious reform and valuing our natural resources over industry interests.\" A tap water ban is still in place in the Charleston region, where many schools and businesses remain closed, but authorities say they can \"see the light at the end of the tunnel\" and they expect the ban to be lifted within days, starting in downtown Charleston and other priority zones, NBC reports."

        "Document": "WASHINGTON \u2014 As the United States military prepares to leave Iraq by the end of 2011, the Obama administration is planning a remarkable civilian effort, buttressed by a small army of contractors, to fill the void. \n \n By October 2011, the State Department will assume responsibility for training the Iraqi police, a task that will largely be carried out by contractors. With no American soldiers to defuse sectarian tensions in northern Iraq, it will be up to American diplomats in two new $100 million outposts to head off potential confrontations between the Iraqi Army and Kurdish pesh merga forces. \n \n To protect the civilians in a country that is still home to insurgents with Al Qaeda and Iranian-backed militias, the State Department is planning to more than double its private security guards, up to as many as 7,000, according to administration officials who disclosed new details of the plan. Defending five fortified compounds across the country, the security contractors would operate radars to warn of enemy rocket attacks, search for roadside bombs, fly reconnaissance drones and even staff quick reaction forces to aid civilians in distress, the officials said. \n \n \u201cI don\u2019t think State has ever operated on its own, independent of the U.S. military, in an environment that is quite as threatening on such a large scale,\u201d said James Dobbins, a former ambassador who has seen his share of trouble spots as a special envoy for Afghanistan, Bosnia, Haiti, Kosovo and Somalia. \u201cIt is unprecedented in scale.\u201d \n \n White House officials expressed confidence that the transfer to civilians \u2014 about 2,400 people who would work at the Baghdad embassy and other diplomatic sites \u2014 would be carried out on schedule, and that they could fulfill their mission of helping bring stability to Iraq. \n \n \u201cThe really big picture that we have seen in Iraq over the last year and a half to two years is this: the number of violent incidents is significantly down, the competence of Iraqi security forces is significantly up, and politics has emerged as the basic way of doing business in Iraq,\u201d said Antony J. Blinken, the national security adviser to Vice President Joseph R.

Crocker, who served as ambassador in Iraq from 2007 until early 2009, said in an interview. \u201cOur timetables are getting out ahead of Iraqi reality. We do have an Iraqi partner in this. We certainly are not the ones making unilateral decisions anymore.

With the Obama administration in campaign mode for the coming midterm elections and Iraqi politicians yet to form a government, the question of what future military presence might be needed has been all but banished from public discussion. \n \n \u201cThe administration does not want to touch this question right now,\u201d said one administration official involved in Iraq issues, adding that military officers had suggested that 5,000 to 10,000 troops might be needed. \u201cIt runs counter to their political argument that we are getting out of these messy places,\u201d the official, speaking only on condition of anonymity, added. \u201cAnd it would be quite counterproductive to talk this way in front of the Iraqis.

At the same time, Afghanistan is asking the United States to remove a bulk of its 45,000 private contractors from the country. \n \n Contractors employed by the State Department will train the Iraqi police and U.S. diplomats in two new $100 million outposts will be left to defuse sectarian tensions in northern Iraq. \n \n The security contractors, defending five fortified compounds around the country, will operate radars to warn of enemy rocket attacks, search for roadside bombs, fly reconnaissance drones and staff quick reaction forces to help civilians in distress, the officials told the Times. \n \n As the exit of the troops was shown live on TV in the U.S. Wednesday, U.S. State Department spokesman Philip Crowley described the end of combat operations as a \"historic moment,\" but vowed that America's long-term commitment was unwavering. \n \n \"The last thing that we want to see is an occasion where we have to send troops back into Iraq yet again so we are ending the combat phase of our involvement in Iraq for a second time,\" he said. \n \n \"We're not ending our involvement in Iraq. We will have important work to do. This is a transition. This is not the end of something. It's a transition to something different. We have a long-term commitment to Iraq.\" \n \n Crowley said that after spending $1 trillion in Iraq and with 4,400 lives lost, the conflict had come \"at high expense.\" \n \n \"We've invested heavily in Iraq and have to do everything we can to preserve that investment to integrate Iraq, along with the neighborhood, into a much more peaceful situation that serves their interests as well as ours. But this is a historic moment.\" \n \n Obama said the events were the beginning of the pullout he promised when he became president. \n \n \"As we mark this milestone in the Iraq war and our troops continue to move out of Iraq, I hope you'll join me in thanking them, and all of our troops and military families, for their service,\" Obama said. \n \n \"My administration will continue to do our part to support the brave men and women in uniform that have sacrificed so much. But supporting our troops and their families is not just the job of the federal government; it's the responsibility of all Americans. \n \n \"Shortly after taking office, I put forward a plan to end the war in Iraq responsibly. Today, I'm pleased to report that -- thanks to the extraordinary service of our troops and civilians in Iraq -- our combat mission will end this month, and we will complete a substantial drawdown of our troops. \n \n \"Consistent with our agreement with the Iraqi government, all of our troops will be out of Iraq by the end of next year. Meanwhile, we will continue to build a strong partnership with the Iraqi people with an increased civilian commitment and diplomatic effort.\" \n \n NewsCore contributed to this report.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 The US military may be rolling out of Iraq, but American civilians are not. To protect its outposts, the State Department plans to double the number of private security guards on the ground, finds the New York Times. As many as 7,000 guards will search for roadside bombs, fly reconnaissance drones, and continue training Iraqi police. \u201cWe need strategic patience here,\u201d says a former US ambassador to Iraq. \u201cOur timetables are getting out ahead of Iraqi reality.\" \"I don\u2019t think State has ever operated on its own, independent of the US military, in an environment that is quite as threatening on such a large scale,\u201d said another former ambassador. But, notes Fox News, the contractors won't be entirely on their own\u2014some 50,000 US troops are staying behind through the end of 2011 to train Iraqi forces.

        "Document": "Alan Miller McCarty watched most of his trial Thursday morning from behind one-way glass in a small room after yelling at, interrupting and crudely insulting the presiding judge. \n \n DAYTONA BEACH \u2014 Alan Miller McCarty watched most of his trial Thursday morning from behind one-way glass in a small room after yelling at, interrupting and crudely insulting the presiding judge. \n \n By mid afternoon McCarty was found guilty on all charges related to his threats to kill another judge who ruled in an earlier custody case involving McCarty. \n \n The jury of three women and three men took about 30 minutes to find McCarty guilty of two counts of threats or extortion and two counts of corruption by threat against a public official. Besides threatening the judge, McCarty also threatened a pair of dispatchers in the phone calls. \n \n When the guilty verdicts were read, McCarty was unusually quiet as he sat flanked by deputies. McCarty faces up to 40 years in prison when he is sentenced by Circuit Judge Matt Foxman. Foxman\u2019s next sentencing date is set for Oct. 12. \n \n McCarty, 36, also faces more charges since he is also accused of calling Stewart-Marchman-Act Behavioral Healthcare and threatening staffers there. \n \n The move earlier in the day to the adjacent room didn\u2019t help much as McCarty continued to shout expletives, curse the presiding judge, the witnesses and the entire judicial system. \n \n Everyone in the courtroom \u2014 Judge Foxman, attorneys and the jurors \u2014 could hear McCarty\u2019s screams, which included offensive expletives. He railed that he was not allowed to present evidence. He screamed that his \u201cpapers\u201d had been taken away. He yelled that his attorney was not asking enough questions. And he hollered that his children had been unfairly taken away from him. \n \n McCarty, who was on suicide watch at the Volusia County Branch Jail, refused to dress as defendants typically do for their trials, in shirt, tie and dress pants. Instead, McCarty remained in his jail-issued orange jumpsuit. Also unlike a typical trial, McCarty wore a pair of handcuffs in view of the jury. \n \n McCarty\u2019s morning outbursts included his derisive invitation to the judge to perform oral sex on him. Foxman politely declined by saying, \u201cI prefer not to.\u201d \n \n After McCarty kept screaming, Foxman ordered him into the small room with the one-way glass. McCarty remained there through most of the trial in handcuffs and accompanied by a pair of deputies. \n \n The judge told the jurors that McCarty had chosen to be in the room to which McCarty could be heard screaming that he did not and that his rights had been taken away. \n \n \u201cNo I have not!\u201d McCarty screamed from behind the mirrored glass. \n \n The jurors did not appear to be fazed by McCarty\u2019s screaming. They didn\u2019t even appear to look back to the mirror-like glass where the shouting was coming from. \n \n McCarty, of Milton in Santa Rosa County, was arrested on Sept. 30. He made phone threats toward Circuit Judge Stasia Warren, who ruled in his earlier custody case. \n \n McCarty was flanked by several deputies when the judge permitted him to return to his seat in the courtroom near Assistant Public Defender Ryan Belanger. He told jurors that he was upset that Warren was allowing that his ex-wife get his kids. \n \n That\u2019s why he said he had made the calls in which he threatened to kill Warren. \n \n One juror seemed to have a pained expression on her face during McCarty\u2019s testimony. \n \n Throughout the trial the judge, the jurors, attorneys and deputies were patient and professional in the face of McCarty\u2019s insults or outbursts. \n \n In a press release after the verdict, State Attorney R.J. Larizza said that McCarty\u2019s \u201cvulgar and threatening racist rants were as chilling and offensive as any I have ever heard. Threatening Judges is an attack on the very heart of our Criminal Justice System.\u201d \n \n Belanger said during his closing argument that the squeaky wheel gets the grease and McCarty was a very squeaky wheel. He said McCarty felt he had no other choice since he was losing his children when he made the threats in the calls. \n \n Assistant State Attorney Ashley Terwilleger, who prosecuted the case along with MaryCatherine Crock, said that McCarty\u2019s words mattered and that Warren was fearful that McCarty would make good on his threats. She also said McCarty\u2019s children had been in Texas since about 2007 and he had not seen them for two years before his arrest last year. \n \n As he was questioned by Belanger, McCarty said his statements on the phone calls were just words. McCarty said he didn\u2019t mean it, just like Foxman didn\u2019t mean it, McCarty said, when the judge on Monday threatened to have the defendant\u2019s mouth taped shut if he didn\u2019t behave during the trial. \n \n Foxman did not follow through on the duct tape but the courtroom was staffed with extra deputies. And while McCarty did not have any adhesive tape around his mouth he did wear an electric belt under his jumpsuit that would allow a deputy to deliver a stunning zap if needed. \n \n McCarty called dispatchers on Sept. 29 and threatened Warren, who hears juvenile delinquency and dependency cases. \n \n \u201cWhere\u2019s your Judge Warren at?\u201d McCarty is recorded telling dispatchers. \u201cYou\u2019re going to bring that (expletive deleted) out in handcuffs and I\u2019m going to (expletive deleted) execute that (expletive deleted) right in the (expletive deleted) street.\u201d \n \n Judge Warren took the stand in the morning and testified that she had been frightened when she was told of the threats McCarty had made against her life. \n \n McCarty was in the small room while Warren testified and would occasionally shout out something. He called Warren \u201can (expletive) liar\u201d at one point during the morning. \n \n Warren started to say something directed at McCarty, but Belanger objected and Foxman sustained it. \n \n As McCarty was about to be escorted out of the courtroom, he said he wanted to press charges against Foxman. McCarty said Foxman had threatened him with taping his mouth shut. \n \n The judge told him one of the bailiffs would take the report from him as McCarty was led out of the courtroom and back to jail. ||||| DAYTONA BEACH, Fla. (AP) \u2014 A Florida man has been sentenced to 20 years in prison for threatening to kill a judge he believed ruled against him in his custody case. \n \n The Daytona Beach News-Journal reports 36-year-old Alan McCarty Jr. spent much of the hearing in an adjacent room with a speaker and one-way glass, just like he did during his trial, after unleashing a fresh stream of obscenities Wednesday at the judge, the prosecutor and even his own public defender. \n \n McCarty was convicted last month of threatening to kill Circuit Judge Stasia Warren last year when he mistakenly blamed her for taking his kids away in a custody case. \n \n A prosecutor's statement says the 20-year sentence will give McCarty ample time to reflect on the seriousness of his threats against the judicial system.",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Florida's Alan McCarty has made clear he does not like judges, and he will spend the next 20 years in prison as a result. The 36-year-old received the 20-year sentence this week\u2014along with an extra 10 days for contempt of court, a penalty more serious than it sounds\u2014for calling 911 last year and promising to kill a judge he mistakenly believed had ruled against him in a custody case, reports the Daytona Beach News Journal. During Wednesday's sentencing in front of a different judge, Matt Foxman, McCarty had to be removed from the courtroom as Foxman listed his offenses. \u201cWhat a bunch of (expletive) lies you stupid piece of (expletive),\u201d McCarty yelled. \u201cYou threatened my life, (expletive, expletive). (Expletive) you, you (expletive, expletive).\u201d Foxman explained that he was tacking on the 10-day contempt of court sentence for a variety of reasons, including one particular McCarty outburst during the trial. \u201cYou also offered me to perform a sex act upon you, which I politely declined and still do to this day for whatever that\u2019s worth,\u201d Foxman said. The extra 10 days will be served when the 20-year sentence is done, and it's no small thing, explains the News Journal. It means that McCarty won't be able to participate in a work-release program while in prison. McCarty also was convicted of threatening 911 dispatchers, reports GateHouse Media Florida, which notes that because of his courtroom behavior, McCarty had to observe most of his trial from behind one-way glass."

Limon's crew was quickly moved away, but moments later, things settled-- and Tordil was in custody. (WATCH THE VIDEO ABOVE) \n \n Shortly thereafter, Montgomery County Police confirmed that a suspect was indeed in custody, and it was Tordil. He was arrested in the parking lot of the same shopping center where the D.C. Beltway sniper attacks began. The first shot was fired to the Michaels craft store, which is still there, on October 2, 2002. Investigators said Tordil ate at the same restaurant, a Boston Market, where John Allen Mohammed and Lee Boyd Malvo ate. \n \n Earlier Friday, two people were killed in two separate shootings in Montgomery County. The first happened outside Montgomery Mall, and the second outside the Aspen Hill Giant grocery store. \n \n MONTGOMERY MALL SHOOTING \n \n On Friday morning at around 11:13 am, an off-duty officer called dispatch and other officers that shots were fired during a confrontation outside of Westfield Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, and two men and a woman were wounded. One of the men died, and the second man is in critical condition at Suburban Hospital. The female victim is also at the hospital in stable condition with non-life threatening injuries. \n \n Police said they believed two of the people who were shot at that scene were hit when they came to the aid of the first victim. \n \n Westfield Montgomery released the following statement regarding the shootings after Tordil was arrested: \n \n \"There was a shooting this morning in the parking lot of Westfield Montgomery and the suspect immediately fled the scene. We worked closely with Montgomery County PD on site and the center remained open serving as shelter for those who wished to remain inside.

We send our heartfelt condolences to the victims of this tragedy and their families. \n \n We encourage you to follow official updates on Montgomery County Police Department.\" \n \n ASPEN HILL SHOOTING \n \n At around 11:50 p.m., a second shooting was reported outside a Giant grocery store in Aspen Hill located on Connecticut Avenue. Montgomery County police confirmed that one woman was shot in her car, and she was pronounced dead at the scene. \n \n SUSPECT ARRESTED \n \n Before Tordil's arrest, Montgomery County police confirmed they were looking into the possibility that Friday's shootings were connected to another deadly shooting that took place on Thursday afternoon outside a High Point High School in Beltsville, Md. Detectives say Tordil shot and killed his estranged wife outside the school in what investigators called a domestic-related shooting. Another man was also shot as he tried to intervene and help the victim. \n \n On Thursday night, police issued an alert for Tordil, who was said to be driving a silver 2015 Hyundai Elantra with Pennsylvania license plate JZA0123. Tordil is an employee of the Federal Protection Service, and police warned that he may have been wearing body armor and may be heavily armed. \n \n Also before the arrest, sources told FOX 5's Marina Marraco that Friday's shootings were connected to Thursday night's shooting, but Montgomery County Police Captain Paul Starks said he could not confirm a connection, and they were continuing to look into the possibility of a connection. \n \n In a press conference late Friday afternoon with officials from both counties, authorities said Tordil was the alleged gunman in all three shootings. Police said officers responding to the Giant parking lot shooting located the vehicle that matched the description parked in the Northgate Shopping Center. \n \n Montgomery County Police Chief Tom Manger said plainclothes officers had Tordil under surveillance in the area and they were extremely careful to make sure they kept the public safe. Authorities said he had earlier threatened to \"commit suicide by cop.\" \n \n \"We had him under surveillance and he was walking from store to store and at no point was it safe to take him into custody until we did,\" said Manger. \n \n After he came out of the Dunkin' Donuts, police cornered Tordil at his car. \n \n \"They came in from all directions,\" said one witness. \"They boxed him in, they rammed the car from the front and the back, pulled guns on him and told him to get out of the vehicle.\" \n \n Without a single gunshot from both police and the suspect, Tordil exited his car and surrendered peacefully. \n \n CHARGES \n \n On Friday night, Prince George's County police officially charged Tordil with first-degree murder and related charges for the fatal shooting of his wife. He was also charged with assault for shooting a bystander who attempted to intervene in the confrontation between the couple. \n \n Charges are pending against Tordil in connection to the shootings in Montgomery County. He was in custody Friday night at Montgomery County police headquarters being interviewed. He will be arraigned in District Court Monday afternoon. \n \n SCHOOLS ON ALERT \n \n A shelter-in-place order was issued for all Montgomery County schools out of what Starks called an abundance of caution, but just before 2:30 pm, that order was lifted at all but five schools. Following Tordil's arrest, all shelter-in-place orders were lifted. \n \n Stay with FOX 5 and fox5dc.com for updates. ||||| A suspected gunman is in custody after two people were killed in separate shootings at a mall and grocery store in Montgomery County, Maryland, today, and police say the shootings may be linked to a deadly domestic shooting in the area yesterday. \n \n The suspect, Eulalio Tordil, 62, was taken into custody today in the Aspen Hill, Maryland, area, police said.

Other than his wife, none of the victims has yet been publicly identified. In a statement late Friday, Montgomery police said Tordil was \u201ccurrently being interviewed by detectives,\u201d and they indicated that he had not been charged in that jurisdiction. \u00ad \n \n The killing began Thursday afternoon, investigators say, when Tordil approached his estranged wife, Gladys Tordil, as she waited in a parking lot at High Point High School in Beltsville to pick up her two daughters. \n \n When a man tried to intervene, authorities said, Tordil shot him in the shoulder. They say Tordil then pointed his weapon at his wife\u2019s SUV, firing repeatedly until she died. \n \n At that moment, her 16-year-old daughter was walking out of a nearby band room. Hearing the shots, another student pulled her back inside and ran to alert others. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s when the whole school panicked,\u201d said 17-year-old Chris Mejia, High Point\u2019s senior class president. \n \n \n \n \n \n In March, at the behest of his wife, a civil court issued a protective order against Tordil for alleged abuse, according to court documents. In the filing, she claimed that her husband, a black belt in the martial-art form of aikido, subjected her children to \u201cintense-military-like discipline\u201d and that he struck her in 2010. \n \n \u201cHe threatened to harm me,\u201d she said, \u201cif I leave him.\u201d \n \n As a result of the order, his employer, the Federal Protective Service, put him on administrative duties and stripped him of his gun and badge. Authorities say they also confiscated a stockpile of his personal weapons. His wife indicated in the protective order that he owned .40-caliber and .45-caliber handguns, an M4 military carbine, a revolver and a \u201chunting gun.\u201d \n \n Under \u201cfavorite quotes\u201d on Tordil\u2019s Facebook page, it lists a single misspelled line: \u201cYou can ran, but you can\u2019t hide.\u201d \n \n Authorities tried to begin tracking Tordil immediately after the shooting at High Point. \n \n They had little to work with and were contending with a suspect whose career in law enforcement made him even harder to pursue, said Prince George\u2019s County Police Chief Henry P. Stawinski III. \n \n Tordil had turned off his phone 20 minutes before the first shooting and never turned it back on. Video of the shooting was grainy and showed only a silver sedan, but police quickly learned that he had leased the Elantra and knew the Pennsylvania license plate number. \n \n That provided them the only firm nugget of information to track their suspect. \n \n Police didn\u2019t release details about the car to the public Thursday night, fearing Tordil might catch on and abandon it, Stawin\u00adski said. But they did inform other law enforcement officers. \n \n \u201cHe is a police officer, and he would be doing countersurveillance on us and watching the media,\u201d the chief said. \u201cIf he knew we knew that was his car, he would get rid of the car.\u201d \n \n More than 100 undercover officers, homicide detectives and special patrol teams from Prince George\u2019s alone fanned throughout the region. The car\u2019s license tag was spotted around midnight, but Tordil eluded authorities throughout the night. \n \n The violence on Friday began about 11:15 a.m., police said, when Tordil fatally shot one man and wounded another man and a woman in the parking lot of Westfield Montgomery Mall. Police said they think that Tordil shot two of the three as they rushed to help the first victim. As of late Friday night, they said the wounded man was in critical condition and the woman in stable condition with non-life-threatining injuries. \n \n Jose Mauricio Gomez, 54, was eating lunch in his pickup when he heard six to eight shots. When a police officer pulled up next to him, Gomez realized that the crime scene was nearby. \n \n Neither man spotted the shooter, but they did see one victim, a woman with a shoulder wound. \n \n The officer asked the woman, who appeared to be in her 30s, whether she could stand. \n \n \u201cThat\u2019s when blood shot out of the hole in her shoulder and he sat her back down,\u201d Gomez said. \n \n The only thing she talked about, he recalled, was how upset her husband was going to be. \n \n While at that scene, officers received a 911 call from the Giant grocery store in Aspen Hill, nine miles away, where a woman had been shot to death in her car. \n \n Soon after, a plainclothes officer spotted Tordil\u2019s car parked across the street from the grocery store, according to McCarthy. Investigators soon realized Tordil was still nearby after showing wanted fliers at area businesses. \n \n Tordil, McCarthy said, first got a cup of coffee at Dunkin\u2019 Donuts, then went to Michaels craft store to \u201cbrowse around\u201d before heading to Boston Market, where he quietly ate lunch near a window. \n \n As many as 100 officers kept up surveillance but resisted closing in to avoid a bloody firefight in a bustling shopping area. \n \n \u201cWe needed to make sure the public was safe when we took him into custody,\u201d said Montgomery County Police Chief J. Thomas Manger. \u201cOur fear was he was armed, since he already shot four people today.\u201d \n \n When Tordil returned to his car, officers swarmed. \n \n He was soon led away in handcuffs, with either rain or sweat soaked through his jeans and light-brown polo. \n \n \u201cThe judgments made today by police saved a lot of lives,\u201d McCarthy said. \u201cThis went down exactly as planned.\u201d \n \n Authorities have no evidence that Tordil knew the people he has been accused of attacking on Friday, leaving investigators to sort through his motivation. \n \n It also remains unclear what led him to allegedly kill his wife, a mother of two teen girls who supported her children and family members in the Philippines. \n \n Gladys Tordil, who taught chemistry at Parkdale High, should have been honored this week \u2014 both for National Teacher Appreciation Week and Mother\u2019s Day \u2014 and not killed in front of her daughter, said Mejia, the student body president. \n \n \u201cMy niece had her as a teacher last year. She said she was a great person,\u201d he said. \u201cShe was always happy, always singing, always dancing.\u201d \n \n On the door of her classroom, more than 100 hand-scrawled sticky notes captured what she had meant to those left behind, a mosaic of memories on squares of pink, blue, green and yellow. \n \n Read one: \u201cTo the reason I\u2019m pursuing Chemistry.\u201d Another: \u201cThank you Mrs. Tordil! Rest in Peace!\u201d And another: \u201cWe will forever love you.\u201d \n \n Ann E. Marimow, Donna St. George, Peter Hermann, Arelis R. Hern\u00e1ndez, Justin Wm. Moyer, Martin Weil, Michael E.

Thomas Manger said. \n \n Police waited about an hour to make the arrest, fearing Tordil was armed, and closed in when he got into his vehicle, Manger said. A weapon was found in the vehicle, he said. \n \n Tordil is an employee of the Federal Protective Service , which protects federal facilities and is part of Homeland Security. \n \n He was placed on administrative duties in March after a protective order was issued against him, the FPS said. \n \n Estranged wife obtained protective order \n \n In March 2016, a Prince George's County district judge ordered that Tordil have no contact with his estranged wife, Gladys Tordil, and two minors thought to be their children. \n \n According to the court documents, Tordil had access to at least three revolvers, which the court ordered him to carry only during work. He had to leave them at his workplace. The FPS said it went one step further after the protective order, removing Tordil's duty weapon, badge and credentials. \n \n Gladys Tordil alleged that Eulalio \"has been subjecting them to intense military-like discipline -- push ups, detention in dark closet,\" according to the order. She said, \"He threatened to harm me if I leave him,\" the documents say. \n \n Prince George's County police charged Eulalio Tordil on Friday with first-degree murder in the shooting of his wife, the department said in a news release posted on its website. He was charged with assault for allegedly shooting a man who tried to intervene. \n \n Montgomery County police have not announced any charges. \n \n Shootings UPDATE: Suspect IN CUSTODY in Aspen Hill area: Eulalio Tordil, 62. Press Conference to be held. Time: TBD pic.twitter.com/cHQJRPa9uP \u2014 Montgomery Co Police (@mcpnews) May 6, 2016 \n \n First shooting at high school \n \n All the shootings happened in parking lots. Besides those killed, three people were wounded. Police said they don't know whether Tordil had a relationship with any of the other people who were shot other than Gladys Tordil. \n \n Law enforcement authorities had been looking for Tordil since Thursday, when Gladys Tordil, 44, was killed outside High Point High School in Beltsville in adjacent Prince George's County, police said. The school was one of the places Tordil was ordered to stay away from in the court order. \n \n It appeared Tordil followed her to the school property as she came to pick up her children and confronted her as she sat in her car, police said. \n \n A passerby was shot as he tried to intervene and suffered non-life-threatening injuries, according to a police report. After the wife was shot multiple times, the gunman left the scene, police said. \n \n CNN Map \n \n Around 11 a.m. Friday morning, one man was fatally shot outside Westfield Montgomery mall in Bethesda, according to police. A man and woman were wounded, police said. The man is in critical condition and the woman in stable condition with non-life-threatening injuries, police said. \n \n While officers were investigating that shooting, they received a call at 11:50 a.m. about a shooting in the Giant supermarket parking lot in Aspen Hill, Manger said. Officers found a woman fatally shot inside her vehicle. \n \n Officers searching for the suspect found his vehicle in a nearby shopping center parking lot, then spotted him inside businesses, he said. \n \n Manger said police decided not to confront Tordil right away because they thought he was armed. The suspect spent about an hour in various businesses and ate lunch at a Boston Market, the chief said. \n \n \"He was walking from store to store and at no point was it safe for us to take him into custody until we did,\" Manger said. \"We needed to make sure the public was safe when we took him into custody.\" \n \n When the suspect got in his car, police blocked the vehicle and made the arrest, the official said. \n \n Tordil is expected in court at 1 p.m. Monday in Rockville District Court, police said. \n \n Remembering the D.C. snipers \n \n The area where Tordil was arrested had significance for residents of the District of Columbia. \n \n The D.C.-area snipers , who killed 10 people in 2002, passed through the area, Montgomery County State's Attorney John McCarthy said. \n \n \"They ate in the same restaurant where we were having the surveillance today, which was an irony that was not lost on me,\" he said. \n \n During three weeks in October 2002 , John Allen Muhammad and accomplice Lee Boyd Malvo, then 17, killed 10 people and wounded three, while taunting police with written messages and phoned-in threats and demands. \n \n Muhammed was executed in 2009. Malvo is serving a life sentence. \n \n \"Today's incident was very reminiscent of fear that permeated throughout our communities during the 2002 sniper shootings,\" Prince George's County Executive Rushern L. Baker III said in a statement on the county government website. \"It was also another harsh reality of the terror that gun violence can create.\"",
        "Ground Truth": "\u2013 Two people are dead following shootings at a shopping mall and grocery store Friday in Maryland, and police have a possible suspect in custody. The first shooting took place around 11am outside the Westfield Montgomery Mall in Bethesda, with two men and one woman hit, Fox 5 DC reports. Two of the victims were reportedly shot when attempting to help the first victim, and all three were hospitalized. According to ABC News, one of the men has died and another victim is in critical condition. Police say there is no indication the shooter knew the victims, the AP reports. The second shooting took place at a grocery store about eight miles from the mall and left a woman dead, the Washington Post reports. It's unclear if the two shootings are related. Police say Eulalio Tordil, wanted on suspicion of shooting and killing his estranged wife outside a Maryland high school on Thursday, may be responsible for one or both of Friday's shootings. He was arrested Friday afternoon, according to NBC News. Tordil allegedly followed his wife to the school, where she was picking up her children, and shot her. Police say he also shot and injured a person attempting to help his wife. CNN reports the 62-year-old Tordil is a law enforcement officer with the Federal Protective Service who was put on administrative leave in March after a protective order was issued against him."

It could also lead to other changes on the borders Britain and France imposed on the Middle East a century ago, starting with break-up of Iraq on sectarian lines. \n \n The success of ISIS can only make the turmoil in the Middle East worse. ISIS is an ultra extremist Sunni Muslim group. Its success will deepen the sectarian conflict between Sunnis and Shias that is already the most dangerous fault line in the Middle East. \n \n Iran, which is a majority Shia Muslim country, shares a border with Iraq. It has a direct line to Iraq's Shia Muslim Prime Minister, Nouri Maliki, and close links with some Iraqi Shia militias. The Iranians could direct their proxies, and even their own special forces units, at ISIS. \n \n That might end up further inflaming the anger of Iraqi Sunnis, who have already helped the advance of ISIS through Iraq. \n \n US air strikes, if they happen, might do the same thing. Once again in the Middle East, the Americans have limited options.
