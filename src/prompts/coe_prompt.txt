Task description: Now you are a multi-document summary generator. 
Your <Input> is multiple texts with similar topics. 
You will extract common key information from them and integrate them into a summary.

----

[The process of summary reasoning]:
(1) Specific event extraction: for each text in <Input>, extract the fine-grained events of the main event body.
(2) Event abstraction and generalization: analyze each fine-grained event extracted in step (1), extract their common feature, abstract and generalize them into a more concise and refined result. For example, [children's program], [weather forecast], [singing program], [TV shopping] can be generalized as [TV program].
(3) Common event statistics: for each abstract event generalized in step (2), find out which text it covers and select the event that covers most of the texts.
(4) Summary generation: based on chronological order or level of importance, integrate the events selected in step (3) to form a concise summary.
