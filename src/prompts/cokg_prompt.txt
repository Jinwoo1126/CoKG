Document: {Document}
Based on the given document, identify the entities and relationships that are the components of the knowledge graph for summarization.

knowledge Graph Components:
- Head (Subject): The entity to be described
- Relation (Predicate): The relationship between the subject and object
- Tail (Object): The entity which describes or be related to the subject

Remember that you should obtain the knowledge graph components with sequential steps as followings.

Step 1. Identify Entities:
Identify and extract entities from the document.
Ensure that you capture the entities and describe them in simple and intuitive words. (e.g., people, places, organizations, key concepts, etc.).

Step 2. Identify Relations:
Identify and extract relations between the entities extracted from the document.
Focus on specifying how predictates have connections with the entities.
Ensure that you capture the relations and describe them in simple and intuitive words.

Step 3. Evaluate Relation Strength:
Identify and evaluate the strength of relations between the entities extracted from the document, assigning a score from 1 to 10 (1 being weakest, 10 strongest, and 5 middle). 
Evaluate strength based on frequency (how often the relation appears) and contextual importance (how critical the relation is to the document's main themes). 
Combine these evaluations to assign an overall score for each relation.

Step 4. Review Document Information:
Please check that the knowledge graph includes the information from the given document.
Compare the knowledge graph with the given document to find any missing entities and relationships. 
If you find any, please update the knowledge graph accordingly.

Step 5. Consolidate Entities and Relations:
Consolidate entities considered the same based on context into a consistent representation. (e.g., "IBM" and "International Business Machines" into "IBM", "Korean Netflix series" and "Korea Netflix series" into "Korean Netflix series").
Consolidate relationships considered the same based on context into a consistent representation. (e.g., "works at" and "employed by" into "employed by", "resides in" and "lives in" into "resides in").

Step 6. Summarize Document:
Summarize the given document based on entities that have the strongest and most frequent relations in the extracted knowledge graph.
Exclude unnecessary details and include only the essential core content in the summary.
The summary is cohesive, flow naturally, and include only objective facts.

The result in the specified JSON format. The keys in the JSON should be 'Knowledge Graph' and 'Summary'.
For the knowledge graph, the key should be 'Head', and the values should be a list containing 'Relation', 'Tail' and 'Relation Strength', respectively.
Answer in JSON without unnecessary introductory text or meta comments.
